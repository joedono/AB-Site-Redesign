* Three incidents will result in the offender having his, her, or their Membership to Anime Boston revoked and he, she, or they may potentially be prohibited from attending future Anime Boston and NEAS events.

### 8. Special Event Seating
* If you've been to Anime Boston before, you might know all about the tickets for concerts and the masquerade. If you haven't joined us before, welcome! We have lots of fun and some fantastic acts lined up!
* This year, we’ve changed our process to hopefully make things clearer. For free events that have a limited number of seats, you’ll need to pick up a Queued Event Pass to be guaranteed a seat. This does not mean you will be turned away at the door without a pass. It does mean people with passes will be seated first. Once they’ve been seated, anyone without a pass will be seated. These passes are only to guarantee you’ll have a seat. So fret not if you missed getting a pass on Friday because you were too busy adulting at work (we feel you).
* Our staff members will be at the Queued Event Pass table located on the third floor of the Hynes across from room 308 on Friday and Saturday, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. (or sooner if all passes are given out). Queued Event Passes will only be available on the day of their event. So you can’t pick up passes to Saturday’s event on Friday, they won’t be available yet!
* One Queued Event Pass per person, per event, and each person must be present with their own badge to pick it up. If you're not sure when your friend will arrive at Anime Boston to pick up their own pass, we recommend selecting floor seating when in the Auditorium; there are more seats available.

## 7. Accessibility at Anime Boston
* *Accessibility Stickers*
Accessibility Stickers can be obtained at the Accessibility Services booth, located in Registration. These stickers are given to any person who might require advanced seating to an event or who may be unable to stand for long periods of time as a result of a disability or injury. One additional sticker may be given to an assistant or companion. Stickers are given out at the discretion of Anime Boston staff to those in need. The sticker is applied to a person’s badge. This sticker allows priority access through the security line and also allows a person advanced seating to major events. Please see the Advanced Seating policy for more information.
* *Advanced Seating*
Advanced seating will be available for events in the Auditorium, Hall D, or any programming where the room is cleared beforehand. Advanced seating locations are at the discretion of Anime Boston staff. Advanced seating will begin no more than ten minutes prior to general event seating. If seating is already in progress, a person with an Accessibility Sticker may bypass the line and proceed to the entrance. If an event requires a special pass for admission (for example: masquerade, concerts), then a pass must still be presented in order to be seated.
* *Wheelchairs*
All Anime Boston partner facilities are fully wheelchair accessible. The Hynes Convention Center has a small number of wheelchairs on site that can be rented or borrowed. Please contact the Hynes Convention Center for more information.
* *Bathrooms*
All facilities have bathrooms that are equipped with handicapped stalls. Please be considerate if you are using one of these stalls to change into your cosplay and allow those who need to use the bathroom first priority.
* *Elevators*
All facilities are equipped with elevators. Please be aware that during the convention, wait times to use an elevator may be longer than normal.
* *Service Animals*
Service animals as defined by the ADA are welcome at Anime Boston. The handler is responsible for the care and supervision of his or her service animal. If the animal is found to be disruptive or behaving in an unacceptable way, without action from its handler, Anime Boston reserves the right to ask that the animal be removed. Under the guidelines of the ADA, we require that all service animals be harnessed, leashed, or tethered at all times unless this affects the animal's ability to perform their required task. If you encounter an individual with a service animal, do not pet the animal. Petting a service animal may distract it from its duties. Whether or not to dress a service animal in costume is at the discretion of the handler.
* *Visual Impairment*
For persons with visual impairment, please see the Advanced Seating policy as listed above.
* *Hearing Impairment*
For persons with hearing impairment, closed captions may be turned on in any video screening room by request.
