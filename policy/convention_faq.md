## What is Anime Boston?
Anime Boston is an annual three-day Japanese animation convention held in Boston, Massachusetts. Anime Boston {currentyear} will be held {startdate} through {enddate} at the Hynes Convention Center and Sheraton Boston Hotel.

Anime Boston is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The staff members that prepare and run the convention are all unpaid volunteers. The cost of your membership to Anime Boston is used directly to create a fun and wonderful experience.

## What's going on at Anime Boston {currentyear}?
As in past years, Anime Boston {currentyear} will be presenting popular events including a masquerade, an anime music video contest, video programming rooms, an artists' alley and art show, karaoke, game shows, video games, manga library, dances, and much more. Our dealers' room will be located in the cavernous Halls A and B of the Hynes Convention Center. We also have some special guests and industry representatives who are excited about coming to Anime Boston.

## What time does it start and end?
Anime Boston usually runs from the early morning until late at night. Video programming will run about 20 hours a day starting at 8am. Panel programming generally starts around 10am and runs through the evening. The dance runs from the evening late into the night. On Sunday, things usually settle down around dinner time.

## I heard I have to bring an ID. Why? What types of IDs are okay?
There are three places at Anime Boston that you will need a photo ID:
1. Checking into the hotel:
    * The hotel will ask to see a valid photo ID when you check into the hotel. A driver's license, passport, or other government issued identification (with a photo) is recommended.
2. Picking up your pre-registered badge:
    * In order to prove to us that you are who you say you are (and so nobody else can claim to be you and steal your badge), we require everyone who pre-registers to show a photo ID when they pick up their convention membership badge at Registration.
    * If you are 18 or over, you must present a photo ID. Driver's license (learner's permits are valid) and passport are the most obvious. Other forms of ID are valid only if they have your name and photo.
    * If you are under 18, you may present any ID that reasonably establishes your identity. School ID with name and photo, a credit card in your name, or a copy of your birth certificate or Social Security card are fine. Since we cannot be familiar with the form of every single school ID out there, we do reserve the right to reject school ID if it seems suspect. We also don't recommend carrying the original of your birth certificate around.
    * If you are under 18, you may also have a parent or guardian (not just a friend over 18) present their government ID and vouch for your identity.
    * Child members (12 and under) do not need ID (but must be accompanied at badge pickup by an adult with a paid membership).
3. Getting into "18+" programming
    * At night, Anime Boston has some events which are "18+". You must show a government issued photo ID (driver's license, passport, etc.) that has your birthdate in order to be admitted to the room. Security will check IDs at the door and have the right to refuse entry to anyone without a photo ID or anyone with an ID that appears to be forged.

If you do not have a photo ID, we strongly suggest that you get one as soon as possible. Even if you do not have a driver's license, your state can issue you an ID. Contact your local Registry of Motor Vehicles for information. If you are in Massachusetts, you can find ID information <a href="http://mass.gov/rmv/license/13bMAID.htm" target="\_blank">here</a>.

## How old are the people coming to Anime Boston? Will there be a lot of kids?
Anime fans come in all shapes and sizes, including kids. While most of the people attending anime conventions typically falls in the 16 to 26 age range, expect to see people of all ages, from 8 months to eighty-eight years.

## Can I take pictures or video at Anime Boston?
Cameras are welcome throughout the convention except in the following places:
* Video Rooms
* The Anime Music Video Contest
* The Art Show
* Any panel or event where the panelist or guest asks people not to use cameras or make recordings.

If you wish to take photos of cosplayers, we strongly recommend that you ask the person first. They will often pose for you to give you a better photo. If you wish to take photos of art in Artists' Alley, please ask the artist first.

## How can I volunteer to help Anime Boston?
You can either [join our Staff](/staff/staff_listing/) or [join our Support Squad](/staff/support_squad/).

## Can I buy Pocky, ramune, or other snacks at the convention?
No. Convention center policies prohibit the sale or distribution of food and drinks by outside vendors. Having convention center concession stands open selling Pocky, ramune, etc. is not possible (Yes, we asked them). If you absolutely must have Pocky, bring it with you or ask the Information Desk how to get to local Japanese snack retailers.

## Is Anime Boston {currentyear} on Easter weekend?
{easteranswer}

## Why does Anime Boston occur on Easter sometimes?
The date for the convention depends on a number of factors, including the availability of both the Hynes and Sheraton, room rates at the Sheraton, and rates for renting the facilities. As such the convention dates tend to move around to keep costs low for attendees. As Easter is also a "floating" holiday, Anime Boston may occur on the same weekend.

Although we have had several Anime Boston conventions on Easter, we have not noticed an impact on our attendance numbers. Attendance continues to increase each year at a steady pace.

## Is there a limit on the number of people you'll allow at the convention?
Starting in 2015, we have established an [Attendance Cap](/registration/registration_cap/) to prevent us from reaching the Maximum Occupancy for the facilities as set by the Massachusetts Fire Marshall.

## What are the dates for future Anime Boston conventions?
