## Before You Register

### How do I register for Anime Boston?
Visit our [Registration](/registration/) page for instructions. Pre-registration will close a week before the convention; after this, you will need to register and pay at the convention during [registration hours](/registration/registration_rates/#hours).

### Is my Membership good for all three days of the convention?
Yes, all Memberships purchased through the online pre-registration process are good for all three days of the convention, with an early pick-up option on Thursday.

### Can I pre-register exclusively by mail?
No, you must pre-register online. After you complete the pre-registration form, you have the choice of mailing in your payment or paying online. The deadline for mailing in your payment is the Friday two weeks prior to the start of the convention (one week prior to the end of pre-registration).

### Do you take PayPal?
No, you must pay with a either a credit card, check, or money order when you register online.

### Do you take credit cards?
Currently, we accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover for online payment. They will also be accepted for on-site registration, in addition to cash.

### Is there a discount for kids?
Yes. Children 6-12 save $10. Children 5 and under are admitted free. Age is determined as of the first full day of the convention. Children 6-12 must be accompanied by an adult (18+) with a paid membership at the time of badge pickup. Children 5 and under must be accompanied by an adult (18+) with a paid membership at all times within the convention space. See our [Registration Rates](/registration/registration_rates/) page.

### Is there a group discount?
Educational/School groups of 10 or more can register as a unit for a discounted rate of $5 off each individual registration. More information is available on our [Group Registration](/registration/group_registration/) page.

### Can I register as a group if I'm not sure who will be in the group yet?
No, the entire group must register as a unit. You may register and pay for someone else, but we need names and contact information for *everyone* that you wish to register.

### Do you offer individual day passes?
The only one-day membership we currently offer is a Sunday-Only Membership, which must be purchased at the door during Sunday Registration Hours.

### What if I just want to go to the dealers' room? Do I still have to register for a full membership?
Yes. Individuals will not be allowed into the convention space without a valid membership badge.

### I'm only coming to run a panel/get an artists' alley table/etc., do I still need to register?
Yes. Individuals will not be allowed into the convention space without a valid membership badge.

Panelists, volunteers, and other attendees who contribute to the convention in particular ways may be eligible for reimbursements; details are provided on the appropriate pages.

### Why do you need my birth date? Gender?
We need your date of birth to determine if you qualify for the child discount and to mark your age. We also use age and gender for aggregate demographics; sponsors really like this information, and sponsors give us free stuff. We only record your age and gender, we do not keep your birth date.

### Why do you need a phone number?
Phone numbers are requested for emergency purposes only. For minors (individuals under the age of 18 at the start of the convention), we require the phone number (US or Canadian) of a responsible party in the event something happens to you at the convention. We only keep it until the end of the convention and only use it in a genuine emergency. If you live outside of North America, please provide the number of a trusted friend in the US or Canada who can help you if necessary.

### Why do you need my email address?
We ask for your e-mail address so we can email you a membership confirmation and in case we need to contact you in regard to your registration. Your personal information will be kept confidential by The New England Anime Society and will not be shared with any other organizations for any reason.

You are responsible for providing an accurate email address and ensuring you can receive email from animeboston.com. If you use a spam filter, we suggest whitelisting animeboston.com.

*Anime Boston is not responsible if you miss important information due to providing an incorrect email address or rejecting email from animeboston.com*.

### Do I need to get my pre-registration in by the date or is that the postmark date?
In order to get the current rate, you must complete the online pre-registration and payment forms by the date listed. We also need to receive your payment within two weeks of your registration. Just send it right away and there won't be a problem.

<span class="text-danger">**DO NOT MAIL YOUR PAYMENT WITH EXPRESS MAIL!**</span> We only check the mailbox once a week and any Express Mail that sits longer than a few days gets returned. Send your payment by *regular* mail. Using Priority or Express Mail is a complete waste of your money.

### How long do I have to pay?
If you are paying via Credit Card, you are expected to pay *immediately*.

If you are mailing in a check or money order, we must *receive* your payment within two weeks. We suggest having your checkbook and printer handy before you start the process; plan on mailing your payment immediately.

If we do not receive your payment within 2 weeks, we will assume you do not want to attend, and will cancel your pre-registration.

### How old do I have to be to get into Anime Boston without adult supervision?
You must be 13 years or older to purchase an Adult Membership to Anime Boston. Individuals 6-12 year old must purchase a Child Membership, which requires that they be accompanied by an adult (18+) with a paid membership at badge pickup time. We expect parents to make their own decisions about accompanying their children throughout the convention; however, we expect children 5 years and under to be accompanied by an adult (18+) at all times. Anime Boston assumes no responsibility for unaccompanied minors. We do not provide babysitting services, nor do we give parents free admission to accompany children.

### What do you mean by <i>party</i>? <i>Party leader</i>? <i>Group</i>?
* **Party** means a bunch of people who registered together, roughly the same meaning as at a restaurant. (If you're registering by yourself, you're a party of one.)
* **Party Leader** is the first person registered in the party. If the person paying for the party registers with the party, that person will be the party leader. Each individual in a party must pick up their own badge.
* **Payer** or "person paying" is simply the person paying for a party's registration.
* **Group** refers to a party eligible for a group discount, available to school/educational groups of 10 or more. **Each person is responsible for picking up their own badge**.

### What can I put in my badge name?
It can be your nickname, your real name, your forum name--whatever you want people to call you. Sorry, we don't support kana at this time; your badge name has to consist of alphabetic characters (including simple accents), numbers, and most standard punctuation.

Your badge name cannot contain anything obscene or offensive in our judgement; we reserve the right to replace your badge name with your first name if necessary.

### Can I purchase more than one badge?
No, in light of the attendance cap, members may only purchase one badge per person.

## After You Register

### I moved after I sent in my pre-registration or I changed my e-mail address. How can I update my address, badge name, etc.?
You can only change your email address and badge name. You must have your current email address used to pre-register, as well as your confirmation code in order to update your information.  If you need to make any other changes to your registration, please [contact Registration Customer Service](/coninfo/contact/127) and we will make the requested changes for you. Please make sure you include your registration information in the email.

<!--
We lock down our database and are unavailable to make changes to the system after March 26, 2017.

Note that this is the only way to change your badge name this year; you will not be able to change it at the convention.
-->

### I pre-registered but haven't received any confirmation. Am I really registered?
Maybe. It is possible your email was entered incorrectly or caught in a spam filter. If you are unsure if you are registered you need to [contact Registration Customer Service](/coninfo/contact/127).

The best way to be sure of your registration is to *enter a complete and accurate email address* when you register. Be sure you can receive email from @animeboston.com addresses, as well. Add it to your whitelist if you use a spam filter. Check your "spam" or "bulk mail" folder.

Be sure to submit payment immediately. Your registration is not valid and you won't receive your confirmation email until it is paid!

*Mailed Payments*  
Assuming you mail payment immediately (which you should!), it takes:
1. 1-2 weeks to reach us in the mail. Express mail will not help, as we only check the P.O. Box twice a week.
2. Up to 1 week for us to check the mailbox and enter the payment in our database. You can check the link in your confirmation email "View My Online Confirmation", which will be updated once your check is received and processed.
3. 3-4 weeks for your payment to clear *our* bank. Just because it's cleared your account doesn't mean it's cleared into ours.

So, *allow six weeks from the time you sent payment* before asking about your registration.

*Credit Card Payments*  
If you pay with a credit card, it should clear immediately.

*In-person Pre-registration Events*  
If you registered in person at a live event and have not received a confirmation e-mail, it is possible that:
1. The registrations have not been entered into the system yet. Please check the [Registration Events](/registration/registration_events/) page and confirm that the event you attended is listed as “complete” before contacting Customer Service.
2. You did not list a valid e-mail address on the registration form. Please contact Customer Service to resolve this, and have proof of payment available (your written receipt or a record of credit card payment).
3. We could not read the e-mail address you listed, or there was a typo on our end. Again, please contact Customer Service with your proof of payment to resolve this issue.

### What happens after I pre-register? What do I need to do next? How do I get my badge?
Your badge will not be mailed; just show up at the convention with a photo ID and the express pass barcode that you will receive in your confirmation e-mail. The express pass barcode is not required; however, it ensures a faster badge pickup. Your first stop should be the Registration Office (Back Bay A) during [Registration Hours](/registration/registration_rates/#hours). Bring a photo ID (this will let us know we're giving your badge to the right person); you will receive badge, lanyard, and registration materials. After you get your badge, you are free to attend any of our events.

It is okay to bring a printout of your registration confirmation email, but it is not necessary, and will not replace the need for photo ID.

### When will registration be open at the convention?
Please [check here for our Registration Hours](/registration/registration_rates/#hours).

### Why should I pre-register for the convention?
Only pre-registered members can pick up their badge on Thursday evening. Pre-registered members also save some money on the cost of their membership. Anyone who pre-registers typically receives his or her badge faster (since we already have your name and payment). Finally, pre-registered members are guaranteed to get into Anime Boston, even if the attendance cap is reached.

### What happens if I arrive after registration closes?
You will just have to wait until it opens the following day. Members cannot attend any convention functions or events without a valid membership badge. We *will* be checking for badges. We will *not* issue "temporary" badges (or any other kind) during the hours registration is closed.

### Can I have my friend pick up my badge for me?
No. Each member must pick up his/her own badge. Party leaders for educational groups will not be allowed to pick up badges for others.

To pick up a child badge, both the child *and* the supervising adult need to be present. Children under 13 do not need a photo ID, but they must be accompanied by an adult (18+).

### What will the badges look like?
We can tell you that the Anime Boston badges will feature never-before-seen mascot art related to our yearly theme.

### I can't go to Anime Boston anymore. Can I get a refund?
Unfortunately, we cannot give membership refunds. This has always been stated on our [Registration Rates page](/registration/registration_rates/). We cannot make exceptions to this rule.

### Can I transfer my Anime Boston membership to someone else?
No. Pre-registration is a commitment that *you* plan to attend the convention. This means *the name you register with must match the name on your ID*, and you are not allowed to change it in your registration (with obvious exceptions such as getting married between registration and the convention).

### My school club already registered, but some friends want to join me. Can I add them to my group?
Sorry, no. All registrations are on an individual basis. If you are registering an educational group, you must have the names of all the members when you register. They cannot join the group at a later date. They will have to register by themselves.

### Is there a limit on the number of people you'll allow at the convention?
Starting in 2015, we have established an [Attendance Cap](/registration/registration_cap/) to prevent us from reaching the Maximum Occupancy for the facilities as set by the Massachusetts Fire Marshall.

### How many people were at Anime Boston last year?
Anime Boston attendance numbers for previous years can be found on our Anime Boston History Page. These numbers include staff, guests, and press. Memberships are only counted once (ie: if someone attends all 3 days, they do not count as 3).

<!-- Some non-anime conventions count attendance multiple times if they attend multiple days. Under that method, Anime Boston 2013's attendance would be somewhere over 57,000. -->

### How do I register for a Press pass?
Information on obtaining a press pass can be found in our [Press Pass](/press/press_pass/) section.

### How do I register for an Industry pass?
Industry passes are handled by our Public Relations division. [Contact the Director of Public Relations](/coninfo/contact/10) for more information.

### How do I register for a VIP pass?
Anime Boston's executive staff members are the only ones who can send out VIP passes. They are typically given to local celebrities, spouses of guests, and athletes who are invited to the convention. There is no application process.

### Other than entrance to Anime Boston, what else can my membership get me?
A membership purchased for Anime Boston only admits you to Anime Boston for that year. It does not admit you to other conventions or events run by the New England Anime Society nor will it admit you to future Anime Boston conventions. For information on other NEAS events, visit <a href="http://www.neanime.org/" target="\_blank">neanime.org</a>.

## Location

### Where is Anime Boston {currentyear} located?
Anime Boston {currentyear} will be held at the <a href="http://www.mccahome.com/jhcc.html" target="\_blank">Hynes Convention Center</a> at 900 Boylston Street, Boston, MA 02199. The official convention hotel is the [Sheraton Boston Hotel](/location/hotel) at 39 Dalton Street, Boston, MA 02116. Some convention events will be located within the Sheraton, which is attached directly to the convention center.

### Is the Hynes Convention Center connected to any hotels?
The Hynes Convention Center is connected to both the Sheraton Boston Hotel and the Boston Marriott Copley Place Hotel via the Prudential Mall. The Sheraton is next to the Prudential's entrance into the Hynes. The Marriott is further away, but still connected indoors via a sky bridge. Though the Hilton Boston Back Bay is close, it is not attached to the Hynes Convention Center. You can reach it by a quick walk across the street from the Sheraton.

### Where do I park my car?
Check our [Driving and Parking](/location/travel_info/) page for assistance on getting here by car and other modes of transportation.

### Will you book a hotel room for me?
No. Except for Guests of Honor, Anime Boston staff, and some lucky volunteers, *everyone staying in a hotel is required to book their own hotel rooms*. See our [Hotel Information](/location/hotel_info/) page for more details.

### What happens if the hotel fills up before I reserve a room?
When a hotel fills up, you'll have to find a hotel room someplace else. We might have a big convention center, but hotel space *IS* limited. If the Sheraton fills early, we may talk to nearby hotels about overflow space, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to arrange space elsewhere. If we do, it will *never* be cheaper than the main hotel.

### Why do I need a hotel room?  Can't I just sleep in a video room or in the lobby?
Anyone caught sleeping in any function room (video room, panel room, etc) will be removed from the room. If we catch you sleeping multiple times, we will ask you to leave the convention. Anyone found sleeping in the lobby will be asked to leave by the hotel. Save yourself the trouble and get a room.

### Do I have to tip the hotel people?
You should. It's how a lot of the hotel staff make their living. Refer to our handy [Tipping Guide](/location/tipping_guide/) for information on what tips are expected in return for various services.

### Is there a pool at the Sheraton Boston?
Yes. The Sheraton has one of the area's largest indoor pools as well as a Jacuzzi, Sauna and Fitness Center available to all hotel guests. Please note that you must be a
hotel guest if you wish to use the pool or fitness center facilities.

## Attendance Cap:

For every year except one, more vendors, industry, panelists and, most importantly, attendees are excited to come to Anime Boston. To handle this growth, we moved from our humble beginnings at the Boston Park Plaza to our current home at the Hynes Convention Center and Sheraton Boston hotel.

This year is no exception. After reviewing our pre-registration numbers and after much discussion among the Anime Boston executive team, we've decided to cap our weekend-only memberships this year. We highly recommend pre-registering as we may reach the cap during at-con registration; we would hate to turn you away at the door because we're sold out.

**This cap does not apply to the Sunday-only Membership sold at the convention.**

To keep you informed, we will be sending out updates on how many available memberships are left on our webpage and via our social media channels on a daily basis. Please follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/AnimeBoston) or [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/AnimeBoston) for our latest updates.

### I pre-registered for a Weekend Membership already. Will I be able to get in?
Yes, as a pre-registered member you are counted in the max number and can get your badge at anytime during open [Registration hours](/registration/registration_rates/#hours).

### Will I not be able to buy a Weekend Membership at the doors?
Weekend Memberships will be available for sale at the doors as long as we have not hit our cap number.

### How do I know how many Weekend Memberships are still available?
The most recent tally of available Weekend Memberships will be listed at the top of each page on the Anime Boston website, beneath the banner image. We will also post updates on on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/AnimeBoston) or [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/AnimeBoston).

### How can I get in if you are sold out of Weekend Memberships?
If we are sold out of Weekend Memberships, you may still purchase a [Sunday Membership](/registration/registration_rates/#at-con). Sunday Memberships are available for purchase only on Sunday.

### Why are you capping Weekend Memberships?
The Hynes Convention Center and Sheraton Hotel have a Maximum Capacity of occupants, set by the Massachusetts Fire Marshall. Exceeding the maximum occpancy would not only be extremely dangerous for everyone, but also illegal. We have chosen to enact this cap on our own to prevent the Fire Marshall from having to do it at the convention.

### Are Sunday only memberships capped?
Sunday only memberships are not capped and do not count towards the cap.

### Why are Sunday Memberships not capped?
Traditionally Sunday has a much lower occupancy compared to Friday or Saturday. We do not run the risk of hitting the Maximum Capacity.

### Can I transfer a Weekend Membership from someone who can no longer attend?
No. Registration is a commitment that *you* plan to attend the convention. This means *the name you register with must match the name on your ID*, and you are not allowed to change it in your registration (with obvious exceptions such as getting married between registration and the convention).

### Will you move Anime Boston to a larger capacity venue, like the BCEC?
Anime Boston is currently contracted to remain at the Hynes Convention Center and Sheraton Boston hotel through 2025. We have no plans to change venues prior to that.

Any possible new venues would have to be a good match for our convention, and Maximum Capacity is only one concern. There are other criteria to consider, such as room sizes and layout, accessible hotels, restaurant availability, and more.

### Other events held at the Hynes Convention Center have 100,000 in attendance. What gives?
Some other events that are held at the Hynes Convention Center do advertise they have 100,000 attendees. But the number presented isn't the whole story.

Typically anime conventions count their attendance according to the number of badges sold (a "warm body" count). You count as 1 attendee whether you buy a Weekend Membership or a Sunday Membership.

But different industry conventions usually count their numbers in turnstile manner. They tally the total attendees for each day separately, then add them all together. So if you had a Weekend Membership, you would count 1 each for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for a total of 3 attendees. A Sunday Membership would still count as only 1 attendee.

There's no right or wrong way to do it; the difference is just industry standards. However, we do give a turnstile attendance report in addition to our regular warm body count. When you look at our recent [Convention History](/coninfo/convention_history) stats, the turnstile numbers are closer to the numbers that other conventions may publish.

### Can I purchase more than one badge?
No, in light of the attendance cap, members may only purchase one badge per person.
