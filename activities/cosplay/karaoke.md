# Karaoke

Sit in the lounge and relax, or strengthen your vocal cords in front of your friends. We have a large library of music and can put lyrics on screen, however it's always a good idea to bring your own CD/Audio player with you if there is a song you really want to sing.

## Open Karaoke Guidelines
The only songs allowed during open karaoke are of Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Thai origin. You may sing songs in English that have been translated from their original East-Asian language. Music that is not allowed includes, but is not limited to: any fan made parody music, music that is from anime created in the United States (L33T Street boys and RWBY will be allowed), Disney music (unless it is the Japanese versions from the Kingdom Hearts game franchise), and standard American music. Songs must not be over six minutes in length to be fair to other participants. Individuals signing up with disallowed songs will be removed from the queue. Participants are not allowed to sign up twice in a row at the queue, even if they are assisting someone else. All music must be of PG-13 rating or less.

## The Number System
In order to move the process along and get people on the stage quickly, each person will be called by the number they are given when they sign up. Participants are allowed to announce themselves when they reach the stage. Your name/call-sign will be kept so no one else takes your number. Your number will be called aloud three times. If you do not respond, we will move on. Please visit the [forums](https://forums.animeboston.com/viewforum.php?f=11) for rules related to karaoke and direct any unanswered questions there.

## Electronic Sign Ups
We are doing electronic sign ups at the desk and via a link on your wireless devices. People really enjoyed this digital feature, so we are bringing it back again this year. Same rules for normal sign ups apply to the electronic sign ups. You can also add web links, so we can find the exact version of the song you want to sing. After signing up you can check the online queue and see how long until you get to perform.

## Karaoke Contest
**Time:** Saturday 5pm - 7pm

Twelve singers will compete live for the karaoke trophy and prizes. Six have signed up in advance and six the day before the contest. There's only one trophy and every audience vote counts! Sign up details can be found on the [forums](https://forums.animeboston.com/viewforum.php?f=11) starting February 27th. There are only six online slots, better be quick to not miss out!
