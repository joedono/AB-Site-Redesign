## Death Match

Thirty-two participants will enter, only one reigns supreme:

Characters go head-to-head to win audience favor and claim ultimate victory. In each fight, two teams enter the stage and the audience cheers (i.e., screams) for their favorite. The loser is wonderfully slaughtered by the winner in mock combat, and the victor moves on to the next round. The last one standing is declared the fan favorite for the year.

Notes on applying:
* Solo or group applications (up to four members total) are accepted.
* Applicants may be matched with characters from the same series to create a new team for the event.

## After Dark Dating Game

Do you like wacky pairings with no canonical basis? This classic is your chance to see your favorite ship set sail as we kick off our After Dark (**18+**).

Each round, an eligible bachelor or bachelorette will ask questions to three potential partners to determine who to choose for a whirlwind romance! Questions range from comedic to innocent to blatant innuendo. Join us for some mature fun at this love-filled event.

Notes on applying:
* Solo or pair applications are accepted.
* **All applicants must be 18 or older.**
* If selected as a bachelor or bachelorette for this event, preparation before the convention will be required, which may include attending rehearsals/meetings.

## Lip Sync Battle
Come cheer on your favorite anime characters as 16 contestants battle to become the ultimate Anime Boston idol. This hit is a highlight you don’t want to miss!

Contestants (usually individual characters, but groups are sometimes accepted) compete with each other in lip sync performances until a single winner is chosen by the cheers of the audience. Pop, rock, Broadway, comedic &mdash; all music genres are accepted. Come for the cosplay, stay for the jamming tunes!

Notes on applying:
* Solo or duets are accepted.
* Applicants will be asked for four songs they would like to perform. Songs will be cut down to between 60 and 90 seconds for the event.

## Improv Battle
Our newest game returns for more cosplay fun that pits your favorite characters against each other... and the audience?!

Pre-selected teams of characters will face off in a series of improv games designed to have you rolling on the floor. But these cosplayers aren't going it alone &mdash; members will be pulled from the audience to help (or hinder) the teams in these challenges.  Who will win? Come find out!

Notes on applying:
* Improv, theater, or other experience in roleplay required.
* If selected, participants will be asked to attend pre-convention meetings and a rehearsal at the convention.

## Shenanigans
What happens in Shenanigans, stays in Shenanigans. All we know is it involves cosplay. And possibly a chicken.

You definitely don’t want to miss this midnight event (**18+**) after the Masquerade!

## Chess

No Anime Boston is complete without the action, drama, and brutal battle of this larger-than-life game of chess!

Cosplayers represent pieces on a giant chess board as the two factions face off in this epic challenge between two chess masters. Every time a piece is taken, the losing piece is destroyed in mock combat &mdash; sometimes with the help of a special attack piece that appears just for the fight!

Notes on applying:
* Solo or group applications (up to four members total) are accepted.
* If selected, participants will be asked to attend a rehearsal at the convention on Saturday morning.

## Other Cosplay Games
The fun doesn't stop with our events. There are opportunities to play around in costume all weekend:
