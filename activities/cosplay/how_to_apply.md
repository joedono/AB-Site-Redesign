All our participants are con-goers just like you. If you’re interested in joining the fun, read below for our step-by-step guidelines for how to apply to our events!

## Step 1: Create an account and log into Cosplay HQ
1. Go to [https://forums.animeboston.com/](https://forums.animeboston.com/).
2. Create a Forums account (if you have not done so already).
3. Log into your Forums account.
4. While logged in, go to [Cosplay Events](/AB-Site-Redesign/participation/cosplay/).
5. Enter all personal and contact information requested by the system.

## Step 2: Add profiles for any costumes you want to use when applying to events
1. In Cosplay HQ, go to "My Costumes" and click "Create New Costume."
2. Each costume has space for a costume name (e.g. Super Saiyan Goku), character name (e.g. Goku), series name (e.g. Dragon Ball Z) and series genre (e.g. anime).
3. Once the costume is created, use the “Manage Photos” button to add up to three photos.
    * We recommend a full front shot, a full back shot, and a close-up of face/wig/makeup or other relevant details.
4. If you do not have your costume yet, feel free to use work-in-progress pictures (if making it yourself) or the store pictures (if buying online).
    * You can also use the “Other Info” section on the costume profile to write notes about pieces you are working on or will be receiving.
    * Make sure to replace these photos with pictures of yourself in the costume before the applications close (if possible).

## Step 3: Complete the application form when applications open
1. Applications will open on January 1, 2020.
    * This will be announced via Anime Boston’s social media channels (Facebook and Twitter) and on the Anime Boston Forums.
2. Log into Cosplay HQ.
3. Under applications, check off any events that you wish to apply for. This will expand the form for that particular event.
4. You can apply for each event with up to three costumes per event.
    * As Anime Boston is an anime convention, cosplays from Japanese sources such as anime, manga, video games, and other Japanese media have a much higher chance of being accepted. Certain events may not be able to accept any non-Japanese costumes.
5. When you are done, click "Submit."
6. Submissions can be updated/edited at any time until applications close.

## Step 4: Look for emails from event coordinators
1. Once applications close, coordinators will make their selections within one to two weeks.
    * Coordinators will provide updates on the forums.
2. Each coordinator will send emails communicating selections and expectations.
