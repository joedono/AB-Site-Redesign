# Cosplay Gatherings

You've spent a million hours on your cosplay. Now, you’re ready to show it off and meet other fans. ... But how? No worries - we've got you covered!

Anime Boston is happy to host Cosplay Photoshoot Gatherings of all kinds, whether your costumes are based on Japanese media or not. We have two kinds of photoshoot gatherings: casual and scheduled. Please note that we do not organize professional paid photoshoots outside of our official photo booth. All of the following are free - by the fans, for the fans. All gatherings held within the Hynes Convention Center and Sheraton Hotel require a general pass to Anime Boston and follow all rules of the convention. All photoshoot gatherings, whether casual or scheduled, are public and open to all cosplayers, photographers, and fans.

**All Anime Boston Cosplay Photoshoot Gathering locations** are designated areas to stop, gather, and take photos. All areas have natural or convention hall lighting with blank walls behind them. No area comes with equipment or a lot of space to spread out in. These areas are not designed for concerts, games, or other physical activities that take up space.

**Casual gatherings** are organized and promoted entirely by you. We do not monitor which places you "claim" and whether or not that place is already taken by another group; we simply provide space in the [Cosplay Forums](https://forums.animeboston.com/viewforum.php?f=22) so you can easily find other gatherings and fans. We provide this directory as a courtesy so you are able to locate the shoots more easily.

**Scheduled gatherings** are a little more structured. We've seen how difficult it can be to organize huge gatherings of fans while trying not to block traffic (and/or cause fire hazards!), or run into scheduling conflicts with other big groups for popular locations. To solve this, we've set aside some spaces that you can reserve ahead of time to ensure you can all meet up and pose to your heart’s content.

Please [click here](/AB-Site-Redesign/activities/cosplay/photoshoots.html) to view the schedule for gatherings at our official Cosplay Photoshoot Gathering locations. Reservations will open on Sunday March 1, 2020. After that time, to submit your own or edit an existing entry, please sign into the [Cosplay HQ](/cosplayhq/) and click on "Photoshoots." Please note that you may need to refresh the page to see the latest gatherings that have been submitted.

### Rules for Scheduled Gatherings

1. Each gathering will have one host that schedules the gathering. This host will be the one to submit for a timeslot. All hosts must read and agree to the Anime Boston Gatherings Policy before submitting for a gathering. Hosts may have a second-in-command during the event that helps organize the group, but the registered host will be the one held responsible for all communications with staff and/or security before, during, and after the con. The host is responsible for ensuring that all members of the gathering follow all Anime Boston rules.    
A single person may host up to four scheduled gatherings during Anime Boston 2020.
2. Gatherings are scheduled on a first-come-first-serve basis. Please check the schedule before submitting a group to make sure the time, location, and series are available.
3. Anime Boston allows one gathering per series per day. As an example, *Final Fantasy* may have a gathering on Friday morning, and another gathering Saturday night, but there cannot be a *Final Fantasy VII* gathering on Saturday morning and a *Final Fantasy Dissidia* gathering Saturday night. This allows more series to get on the schedule to meet up and lets the greatest number of fans meet at one time. Also, attendees will not have to attend two gatherings or decide between them.
4. If multiple hosts sign up for the same series on the same day, then the first host will get priority and keep their gathering, while the other hosts will be contacted and asked to combine or reschedule.
5. All submissions for a gathering must include a link for the event. Anime Boston Forums, Facebook, or any other social media site is acceptable as a link. This is so people can post and find pictures and each other after the event. The link must remain publicly available and let others communicate with each other.
6. Reservations can be made for 30-minute, 60-minute, or 90-minute time slots. Thirty minutes is recommended for groups under 30 cosplayers, 60 minutes is recommended for groups up to 100 cosplayers, and 90 minutes is for groups expecting over 100 cosplayers. If the interest gauged in a gathering is thought to be over 300 cosplayers, then please contact Anime Boston staff so we can better accommodate you.
7. Gatherings may only be held within the time allotted for them. Gatherings may not start early or end late if another group is scheduled during that time. Please be prepared to settle a group and begin when the time starts, and start to wrap up the gathering at least five minutes before the scheduled ending time. Please be courteous to the next group.
8. The host of a gathering, Anime Boston Security, or other Anime Boston staff have the right to end a gathering early. Anime Boston Security and other Anime Boston staff have the right to change a gathering’s time or location at any time.
