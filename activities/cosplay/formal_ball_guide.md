# Formal Attire Inspiration Guide

Cosplayers are quite welcome at the ball! However we ask you please remember that it is a formal dance event first and foremost, and the [dress code](/programming/formal_ball/#dress_code) must still be adhered to.

Think to yourself, "What would this character wear to a formal event?"

Cosplay for men and women should resemble formal wear of the non-costume variety (long gowns, formal military attire, etc.) School uniforms, armor, chains, and excessive belts are all considered informal.

Large props, wings, weapons, or anything that impairs your field of vision will not be allowed in the event as they are an impediment on the dance floor and may be broken or harm others. Anime Boston reserves the right to ask for the removal of
costume portions or props that are problematic.

Below you will find both examples of cosplay that is already perfectly formal as well as one that can be made formal with a little creativity.

### Video Games
Video games can be a wonderful source of formal costumes. Also keep in mind that if you're favorite character's everyday wear isn't quite up to snuff, many characters have alternative outfits in art books or final cut scenes.

### Western Ideas
The land of the rising son isn't the only source for great formal outfits; you may want to consider a favorite character from your childhood or the comic book shelf.

### Japanese Clothing
Whether traditional or trendy many Japanese clothing options would be good choices for the ball. For modern clothes a good rule of thumb is: if the item is an interpretation of traditional formal wear east or west, its likely a good option for the
ball.

### Military Minus the Boots
Formal military outfits can be quite dapper. As explained in the FAQ since this is a dancing event boots are not allowed but for many, many military outfits plain dress shoes can easily be substituted for boots. When contemplating an outfit that
normally contains tall knee high boots consider lengthening the pants or wearing tights underneath to achieve a similar silhouette.
