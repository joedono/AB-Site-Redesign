# Guests FAQ
{:.no_toc}

These are Frequently Asked Questions regarding our Guests of Honor. Please review them and if your question still isn't answered, feel free to ask on [our forums](https://forums.animeboston.com).

## How are guests selected?
Anime Boston takes guest suggestions from the public in the [Guest of Honor](https://forums.animeboston.com/viewforum.php?f=3) discussion forums. These suggestions (as well as suggestions from staff members) are reviewed by the members of the Guest Relations Staff. The staff helps narrow the list down and the Director of Guest Relations begins to track down the potential guests on the list and offer invitations.

Soon after a guest accepts our offer, they are announced and added to the Guests section of the web site. Until a guest is announced, Anime Boston can neither confirm nor deny if someone has been invited as a guest.

## Can I be a guest?
If you're someone who has done something of note in the anime or manga industry, <a href="/coninfo/contact/7">drop us a line</a>!  Unfortunately, we receive many more people asking to be guests than we could possibly afford to have at the convention. Please do not be offended if we turn you down, even if you offer to come for free. We hope you understand that our Guest Relations staff is limited and can only handle so much work. However, you are still welcome to attend the convention and can apply to host a panel if you wish.

## Will you be getting a Japanese guest?
We'll try. Refer to our [Guest Listing page](/guests/guest_listing/) to see who has been announced.

## Why do you get so many dub voice actors as guests?
There are a number of reasons why conventions tend to get more North American guests than Japanese guests. North American guests are very popular within anime fandoms. They also have the added benefits of not needing a translator, being able to go into the city without an escort, and are a lot cheaper than flying in from Japan.

## I heard a rumor that XXXXX would be a guest. Is that true?
It is our policy that Anime Boston staff cannot discuss specific guests until they have been formally announced. From time to time, someone will ask if a specific person or group will be a guest when there has been no formal announcement about that person or group. In these cases, the answer will <em>always</em> be "We can neither confirm nor deny."  The answer will always be that we cannot say if someone is or isn't a guest.

It's best not to ask about unannounced guests and just wait patiently. Even if that guest has us listed on their own web site, we won't say anything until a press release or other formal announcement is issued.

## Why don't you say who you're considering as guests?
There are actually several reasons why we don't share the list of people we're inviting as guests:
1. Since rumors tend to be read as facts on the internet, we want to avoid rumors that a specific guest may be attending Anime Boston. We don't want people showing up to Anime Boston expecting to see someone who was only rumored to be attending.
2. If it turns out a guest can't come for some reason, it could potentially upset fans who either blame the convention for not trying hard enough, not being willing to pay excessive expenses, etc. or the guests for not being able to make time for the convention, choosing to attend a different convention, etc.
3. The Guest Relations staff prefers to discuss our convention with potential guests ourselves. If everyone else knew who we were talking with, they might get approached by non-staff which could lead to confusion as to who is doing the actual inviting.
4. It irritates us when people post on [the forums](https://forums.animeboston.com/), Facebook, or Twitter claiming to know who we're inviting. If they are right, they've ruined the surprise and annoyed us for doing so. If they are wrong, they've only spread false rumors. If, for some reason, you know who an unannounced guest is, do us a favor and keep it quiet until we're ready to announce!
5. We like surprises.

Often, we may have guests confirmed but are waiting for something before making a formal announcement. We may be working out details, waiting for a bio, waiting for a similar guest so that they can be announced in the same press release, waiting for a publicity photo, etc. There are always *valid reasons* why we haven't announced guests right away. Once everything is worked out and we have everything we're waiting for, we make a formal guest announcement.

## Where do you announce guests?
Guest announcements are posted on our [home page](/), [Guest Listing page](/guests/guest_listing/), [forums](https://forums.animeboston.com/), and [Social Media Community](/community/), in addition to being sent out to anime news web sites and other appropriate places.

## I noticed that another con had a guest list similar to yours?  Did you steal their idea?  Did they steal yours?
In trying to host the best anime convention, many conventions end up contacting the same guests; therefore, there may be some similarities in the guest lists. Anime Boston does not copy guest lists from other conventions. The Guest Relations staff carefully chooses guests that will appeal to the varied interests of our attendees. We are confident that other conventions never intentionally copy our list.

## I'm friends with someone you may want as a guest. Should I invite them for you?
Please **do not invite guests on behalf of Anime Boston!** You are perfectly welcome to send their contact information to the [Director of Guest Relations](/coninfo/contact/7), but we strongly urge people not to invite guests on their own. In the past, guests have been invited to Anime Boston by individuals not affiliated with the Guest Relations staff. The guest then contacted Anime Boston for information about their guest status. This created confusion since our Guest Relations staff never sent them an invitation. It also put the convention in an awkward position of possibly offending a potential future guest by informing them that they were not invited and that Anime Boston does not currently have room in the guest list. Please help us avoid this confusion and do not contact guests on our behalf. If you want to do us a favor and help, just forward the guest's contact info to the [Director of Guest Relations](/coninfo/contact/7).

## I'm friends with someone you have as a guest. Can I meet up with them at the con?
Everyone is welcome to attend the guest panels. You can say hello there.

## Why don't you get more web comic guests?
While Anime Boston is primarily focused on anime, manga, and Japanese pop culture, we do recognize the growing popularity of web comics and their broad appeal across many spectrums of fandom. The Anime Boston Art Track is part of our efforts to reach out and include popular web comic artists to be featured in our Artists' Alley.

We want to continue our web comic artist participation. However, given scheduling, contractual, and budget constraints, we have to keep our focus on our core mission.

## What days will the guests be there?
Unless we say otherwise, all of our guests will be at the convention for all three days. Guests will have various panels and autograph signings scheduled throughout the weekend. There is no one day when you can attend all the guest panels and get all their autographs. (There aren't enough hours in the day for us to do that even if we tried.)

## When can I get autographs?
When the autograph schedules have been set, they will be announced. Scheduled autograph signings will be scheduled throughout the weekend. Be sure to check the schedule at the convention since many autograph sessions are not on the same day as the guest's Q&A panel. Q&A panels are **not** intended for autograph signing. Autograph seekers **will get turned away** even if you are only at the convention for that one day or you missed an earlier autograph session.

## What can I have guests sign?
To be fair to everyone that would like an autograph, there is a limit of one autograph item per person.

*Good autograph items:*
* DVD cover of a show a person was involved with
* The inside cover of a book an artist or writer's work appears in
* Anime Boston program guide (it has autograph space in the back)
* An autograph book
* Blank paper

*Bad autograph items:*
* Bootlegged or unlicensed items
* Items from shows the person was not in
* Items from shows you suspect the person was in and credited under an alias
* Body parts
* T-shirts (they're difficult to write on)
* Convention badges (they're very small and guests like to write big)
* Food (including jars of pickles)

## Can I give the guest a present?
Yes, but...
* ...do it when it's your turn at the autograph session.
* ...don't give them food. They probably won't eat food from strangers and some guests have food alergies.
* ...don't ask them to put on a shirt right away. Some guests are modest.
* ...don't expect anything special in return.

## What is Anime Boston's Autograph Policy?
You can find our Autograph Policy in our [Convention Policies](/coninfo/convention_policies/#autograph) section.
