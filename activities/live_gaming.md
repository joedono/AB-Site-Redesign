# Live Gaming

Live Gaming at Anime Boston is your chance to play a variety of traditional games - board games like King of Tokyo and Settlers of Catan, card games like Magic: the Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh, and roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons. We have a giant library of games you can borrow from or bring one of your own! Looking for more players? We've got tools to help you find people to play games with, too!

In addition, please join us for a variety of special events and unique experiences! We have giant life-sized board games and we are going to be running some massive multiplayer games including Catan: the Big Game, and Rollin' Ink, so check the schedule for details or stop in!

For event schedules and demonstrations, please check Con Chowdah or the Guidebook App. For more information on any of the games, drop by the Live Gaming room!
