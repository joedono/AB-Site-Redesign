    <p>If you are new to Art Track, you may be wondering "What is Art Track?"</p>
    <p>Art Track is the name of all the great programming that we do in Artist's Alley.</p>
    <p>Each year we select artists to spotlight. Each Featured Artist will host art themed panels where you can benefit from their knowledge and experience on topics ranging from getting published to colorization and more.</p>
    <p>For the past few years Artist's Alley has proudly carried out Artist's Alley Trading Cards, an activity for artists to trade samples of their art in a business card sized 3.5 in x 2 in format with each other. This activity is limited to artists.</p>
    <p>There are more new and upcoming events in the works besides this that may allow different levels of participation for both artists and attendees.</p>
