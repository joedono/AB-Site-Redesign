We're happy to announce that the Charity Auction will be returning to Anime Boston 2016!

Every year Anime Boston is proud to donate a constantly-increasing amount to our chosen charity, the <a href="http://www.nationalmssociety.org/chapters/MAM/index.aspx" target="\_blank">National Multiple Sclerosis Society</a>. Last year we were able to give over $20,000 thanks to our generous bidders.

Join us again this year at our "Sneak Peek" table in the Dealers' Room to catch a glimpse of the choicest swag before it hits the auction block. On Saturday, March 26th, we will be holding raffles all day; be sure to buy tickets for a chance to win all kinds of fabulous stuff!

As usual, the big event itself will be on Sunday, March 27th! Look forward to scoring some unique and fun items, while having a great time with our energetic auctioneer! Surprise guests, bidding wars, last minute treasures; you never know what you're going to see at the Anime Boston Charity Auction. We hope you'll join us!

Don't forget to check us out on our new <a href="http://www.facebook.com/AnimeBostonCharity" target="\_blank">Facebook</a> page for all the latest updates before and during the convention!
