Welcome to our first ever milonga! Anime Boston is proud to celebrate the sumptuous tango during our semiformal dance. Join us for a night of both Argentine and traditional ballroom style tango to music inspired by Asian pop culture.

Unlike most events at Anime Boston, Tasty Tango is a limited capacity and ticketed event. Tickets are $5 dollars and proceeds will benefit the National MS Society. Tickets can be purchased approximately one hour before the Friday afternoon formal ballroom dance lesson (in Hynes Panel A) or at the event itself.

A specific Argentine tango lesson will be held during the first 30 minutes of the semiformal.

Please note that this is a semiformal event. The dress code, while less stringent than that of the formal ball, will be enforced. Those in male attire should wear the equivalent of a button down shirt, slacks and dress shoes. Those donning female attire should wear the equivalent of a cocktail dress or slacks and a dressy top. Informal clothing such as miniskirts, bare midriffs, ripped clothes, vinyl, chains, platform boots, or sneakers, as well as large props or anything interfering with your field of vision are not allowed.

Running Time: 180 minutes

Category: Ball

Showing Times: Saturday at 5 p.m. in Hynes Panel A
