# Cosplot

## What is Cosplot?
Each year, Anime Boston runs a unique storyline around its Cosplay Programming. It’s the narrative that gives context as to why certain games are happening and breaks up the action. The plot consists of a series of performances by Cosplay Games staff and participants performed throughout Cosplay Games, at the Masquerade, and through the Catch the Barrel game.

## What is the plot for this year?
We’re not revealing the Cosplot for this year yet, as always - but you can bet that it’ll include a relatively minor kerfuffle that’ll start at Death Match, escalate throughout Friday and Saturday, until there’s no other way to settle the issue than through a brilliant game of Chess on Sunday.

## How do I get involved?
There are a couple ways to get involved:

1. **Apply to Anime Boston Cosplay Games!** Anyone who is selected for a Cosplay Game is eligible to be a part of cosplot.
2. **Apply to the Anime Boston Cosplot pool!** There is a dedicated pool for applicants who are interested in getting into Cosplot. Applications can be submitted through Cosplay HQ using the same process outlined on the [Cosplay Games page](/cosplay/cosplay_games/#apply).  
a. Characters should originate from Japanese culture or media. For more information, see the [FAQ](/cosplay/cosplay_faq/#7).  
b. Applying with very popular characters and/or characters that match the convention theme will increase your chances of being accepted.

## What are examples of Cosplot in the past?

### 2019:
B-kun leads the Shinsengumi in the fight for the progress of time in the belief that the old must die so the new can live. A-chan is a lone ronin battling to protect the old ways and stop the new ways from  destroying traditions. Starting at Death Match, A-chan and B-kun dueled at every Cosplay Game, trying to sway the other characters and audience to their side. The war escalated until it was too big for a single event and they agreed to settle it at Chess. A-chan and her team of traditional fighters put up a good fight against the modern team (and B-kun leading team S.I.T.C.A.S.), but ultimately, they learned that both new and old are needed to move forward. Cue Protagonist Speech&trade;.

### 2014:
Anime Boston Academy classes were interrupted by delinquents Gazille and Lupin III throughout the weekend. They demanded that Cosplay Games and the Masquerade be made more fun - by throwing out the rules! The School Disciplinary Committee investigated and found that Haruhi Suzumiya was the culprit; she had grown bored and wanted to cause some chaos! But Saber, leader of Order, challenged her to a Chess duel to settle things once and for all. Having reached a stalemate, Haruhi tried to use the weapon trapped in the Barrels, but only found a book! Although her Chaos allies were quick to turn on her, Order came to her defense and the day was saved by Peace and Friendship. But Haruhi still had to write a book report.

### 2009:
Who killed Sailor Moon? Who attempted to kill Kamina? Those are the questions that B-kun was trying to answer! But it turned out the killer was Tohru Honda?! The trial began at Chess, with Godot leading the prosecution and Phoenix Wright defending Miss Honda. Once the Chess pieces were reduced to 12, they became a jury. The vote came down to 9:3 in favor of Tohru being Not Guilty, and the real killer was revealed to be: Xellos! The rest of the chess pieces went to work to defeat the monster while Cloud used a Phoenix Down to revive Sailor Moon and save the day!

### 2008:
Each team: Ninja, Shinigami, Alchemists, and School Clubs hoarded a Secret Super-Weapon for use in a battle of Good vs. Evil. Akatsuki tried to unite the villains to get all the weapons. When Good and Evil arrived to fight Chess, Good refused to fight and insisted on a wholesome Kids vs Grown-ups match instead. Evil kept trying to disrupt everything, which upset some members of the Good team and they decided to Sit In The Corner And Sulk (SITCAS)™, led by Sasuke Uchiha. Evil took over, but SITCAS and the Pirates rushed to the rescue to defeat the Evil team.
