# Cosplay Repair

Not sure how to fix something, or no good with a needle and thread? No problem! Our staff are experienced in the art of quick costume fixes, and we’re here to give advice or lend a hand as needed.

Some of the supplies we have, free for the use of Anime Boston attendees:
* Safety pins
* Tape and glue of all varieties
* Needles, scissors and thread
* Hair pins and elastics
* Wig styling supplies
* Zipper repair supplies
* and much, much more!

Please note that we don’t have make-up supplies beyond remover (as we can’t sanitize it between people), or power tools (too much risk of injury or damage to the room).

The Cosplay Repair Station started in 2014 as a one-person effort within the Cosplay Games department by Pat Sullivan. The need he saw turned out to be much bigger, and we’ve since grown to seven people with our own room, dedicated to helping the Anime Boston cosplay community.
