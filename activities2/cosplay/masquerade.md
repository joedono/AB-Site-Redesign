The Masquerade is a Saturday night theatrical performance in which groups of fans display their costuming and acting skills. The participants create and perform short skits based on their favorite anime or Japanese video game. These skits can be dramatic, comedic, dance-based, or just plain wacky! A panel of staff and celebrity judges present awards to the best performances and costumes. The Masquerade is just as fun to watch as it is to participate in!

Anime Boston, unlike many other conventions across the United States, has merged our Hall Cosplay and Masquerade contests into one contest called simply the Masquerade. You can still get judged on your craftsmanship alone, just as you would at a Hall Cosplay Contest; the difference is that you will be competing against participants who choose to get judged on performance in addition to craftsmanship.

Indicate when you sign up whether you wish to be judged on craftsmanship, performance, or both. If you choose only craftsmanship, you will not be expected to have a skit planned, though you are still welcome to participate in the catwalk.
