**1\. <a name="1">Why do you need staff members for Anime Boston?</a>**  
Anime Boston attendance has reached over 22,000 members. It takes more than 350 staff members to put on this event. The hardwork and dedication of the staff members help make each convention a success. We are always looking for new people to bolster our ranks and bring their own ideas and creativity.

**2\. <a name="2">When would I have to work?</a>**  
Most staff members only work during the convention weekend. Generally, all of them are required to work at least 24 hours over the course of the weekend. But there are also staff members who put in time throughout the entire year to prepare for the convention. Which area you may fall into depends on the position you sign up for. Your Department Head will contact you to let you know.

However, all staff members help with the Thursday morning load-in and setup of the convention facilities. After setup is finished, everyone reports to their normal duties. And after the convention has concluded on Sunday afternoon, everyone helps with the breakdown and load-out.

**3\. <a name="3">Do I get paid for working on Anime Boston staff?</a>**  
All staff positions, from the Chair down to the newest staff member, are unpaid. We are all volunteers. Even though we put in a lot of hard work and time into running Anime Boston, the reward for us is the fun and satisfaction of creating an awesome event that people love.

**4\. <a name="4">Do I have to go to meetings?</a>**  
Anime Boston staff members have monthly meetings in Boston. Dates and locations are posted well ahead of time in the private staff forums. While it's not mandatory to attend, we urge you to consider it. Meetings are a great way to get involved and meet new people and who you will be working with at the convention.

The only mandatory meeting is the All-Hands Staff Meeting on Thursday night at the convention. Everyone must attend for it unless excused by their Department Head.

**5\. <a name="5">Is there a place to sleep?</a>**  
All Anime Boston staff are entitled to a hotel room from Thursday night to Monday morning. However, there is no obligation to stay in the staff hotel rooms. Some staff members prefer to commute from home or stay with their friends in another hotel room. There is a section on the Staff Application to request your staff hotel room space.

Each staff hotel room houses no more than 4 staff members. If there are people on staff you would like to room with, please indicate their names on your hotel room request when submitting your Staff Application. We will make the best effort possible to make roommate requests happen.

Non-staff members are not permitted in staff hotel rooms for any duration under any circumstances.

**6\. <a name="6">Is there food available?</a>**  
Over the course of the weekend all staff will get vouchers which are good at most of the restaurants in the Prudential Center mall. There are 2 vouchers for Friday, 2 for Saturday, and 1 for Sunday. These vouchers will get you anything from a burrito, to a salad to Chinese food. And don't forget to stay hydrated!

**7\. <a name="7">What are the different T-shirt colors I see staff wearing?</a>**  
There are 3 official T-shirt colors for Anime Boston staff. Orange shirts are our general Security staff. They are responsible for line organization, badge checks, crowd control, and generally keeping everyone safe. Red shirts are Security Managers. They oversee the Orange shirts and respond to any emergencies that may arise. All other staff members are Blue shirts. They can belong to any other division including Exhibits, Operations, Programming, Public Relations, Registration, and Technical Operations.

**8\. <a name="8">How do I get a staff T-shirt?</a>**  
All staff are given 1 free T-shirt, color is determined according to their job responsibilities. Staff T-shirts are year specific, so there is a new one each year. Staff T-shirts must be worn while on duty. If you would like any additional staff T-shirts, you must request them in advance. Each additional staff T-shirt is $5. If you are unsure of what size you requested or how many, ask your Department Head.

**9\. <a name="9">I've never staffed an anime convention before. Where's a good place to start?</a>**  
While many of the jobs on staff can seem daunting, there are plenty entry-level positions. If you are new to anime convention staffing, these positions can ease you into being a productive staff member.

Here are some good suggestions for starting out on staff: Security Staff help manage line organization, check badges, control crowds, and generally keep everyone safe. Registration staff process the membership registrations of everyone who comes to Anime Boston. Junior Technical Staff help with all technical aspects of the convention such as DVD player operation, audio engineering, camera operation, lighting design, and more. All of these positions are overseen and mentored by veteran staffers who will help and guide you.

**10\. <a name="10">What is the Dead Dog Party?</a>**  
On Sunday evening, after the staff has packed up all of the convention supplies and delivered them to storage, there is a special staff party called the Dead Dog. This party is a great place to meet other staffers, unwind from the stress of the weekend, and share stories. Food and beverages are provided free of charge. Individuals 21 or older may choose to purchase alcoholic drinks with their own money. The Dead Dog party is only open to staff members of the current convention year.

**11\. <a name="0000">What should I do now?</a>**  
Check out the [Staff Listing](/staff/staff_listing/) for a breakdown of all positions. There are details on what each job does. If the position still has openings, there will be a link to apply for it.

If you have questions about a particular staff position, feel free to [contact the Department Head](/coninfo/contact/). They will do their best to answer your questions.
