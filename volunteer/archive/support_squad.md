Anime Boston Support Squad members are attendees who help out the convention but aren’t held to the same level of commitment as a staff member. Squad members do not have a minimum work requirement and have more freedom to enjoy the convention; they can help out anywhere from 15 minutes to over 20 hours! By signing up, you could help put on a great show, earn prizes, make new friendships and connections, and give back to a community you love!

## How to Join the Squad

* Squad members that will be 16 or 17 years of age at the time of the convention must sign up as a minor.
* If you apply online and your application is accepted, you will receive a welcome email.

    * If accepted, squad members signing up after the Friday morning orientation will not be permitted to work until provided with an orientation.

## Squad HQ

Support Squad Headquarters is where all squad operations are managed. This will be your home base while you’re helping out at Anime Boston. Squad members attend orientation, check in and out for shifts, and can store personal belongings in HQ.

## Squad Shifts

Squad shifts can range from 15 minutes to four hours. The workload is paced to allow you to rest, eat, hydrate, and enjoy the convention.

* Once accepted to the roster, squad members will be able to mark down their availability in our squad portal. Support Squad staff will then use that availability to design a shift schedule that works for each squad member.
* Before each shift, squad members will need to check-in at HQ.
* When heading out for a shift, squad members will be given instructions and supplies as needed to carry out their duties.
* After finishing an assigned shift, squad members should then return to HQ to check back in.  A member of the Support Squad staff will record the completion of each shift.

## Meals & Prizes

* Every four hours of helping out (up to 20 hours) earns you a gift and a meal voucher.
* Sixteen hours of helping out earns you reimbursement for your convention membership.
* We like to reward excellent squad work with special prizes!
