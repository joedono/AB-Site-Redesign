Anime Boston Usability Testing
Overview
Animeboston.com is undergoing a major website overhaul. The changes will affect the source code, information architecture, website layout and the overall look and feel of the site. For the first round of testing, we would like to focus on the content structure and site navigation. The scope of this research is limited to the various use cases that have been identified by the webmaster. Any new use cases are worth noting for future iteration. Following each use case, testers will put themselves in the shoes of one or more of these personas.
The goal is to accomplish a given task, and document the overall experience throughout the user journey.
Goal
Attempt to complete the given task, for any of the key personas.
Identify blockers, challenges and areas of improvements.
Surface known and unknown errors/bugs to prioritize and resolve.
Ensure the new content is responsive and accessible.

User journey analysis
Persona: Attendee
Level of knowledge/Awareness of AB: First time (Novice)
Goal/Success: Learn more about AB and how to attend.
Navigation structure
Main nav:
The IA and categorization could be improved by collapsing redundant links into the same sections. I suggest doing some card sorting to narrow down the number of links in the nav and make better sense of links that should be grouped together.

Info (this is too vague, the assumption is all the information I am looking for could potentially be located here. Which is not the case. I also recommend against making the contact us, about ujs, around Boston the first items in the nav. These are really supplemental information and chances are most people do not come to this page to answer questions related to any of the above items.)
Attend / Registration (This can be called out as a CTA on the landing page, and possibly a 1 level menu item.)

Activities
Programming  (Label: Schedule or Event Schedule) The current spreadsheet calendar is super inaccessible and does not offer a great experience for mobile devices. Consider using an embedded Google calendar or something similar instead.)
This is not an activity/Event
Guests (This looks like a photo gallery? The label “Guests” is very unclear. Suggest sticking to “Photo Gallery” or “Media” something of the sort.)
Do we need to point out that certain guests are Japanese?
Use a different component for the gallery. Thinking of edge cases, this can easily get very long and a scrolling or pagination nightmare.
This is not an activity/Event
Dealers Room  (This page would be useful if it was usable, but I already anticipate a lot of accessibility challenges and just general usability issues. All booths are current links which only create a new exhibitors tab when the user clicks on them.)
Keep in mind most people visiting the site will most likely be on their mobile device, particularly if they plan to use this map the day of, at the convention.
If this can be made interactive or simplified significantly to account for mobile experience that would be great!
Are you an Exhibitor/Artist? What is the purpose of these 2 buttons? They currently do nothing when clicked on.
This is not an activity/Event
Artists Alley (RE: above comment.)
Cosplay (Possibly a 1 level menu item.)
Live Gaming (Is this worth a whole page?)
Charity Auction (Possibly a 1 level menu item.)
Media (Media is not a clear label,.)
Participation (This section seems to be primarily composed of rules, guidelines and FAQ. The link label should be changed to something that reflects that.)
AMV Contest
Blood Drive
Panel Application
Cosplay Events (all cosplay options should be combined under the same group.)
Cosplay Gatherings (RE: above comment.)
The embedded calendar used on this page is much more usable than the Events calendar. I suggest using this component consistently across the site.
Cosplay Forums (RE: above comment.)
This sends the users away from the website without warning or preperation. This is a convention that should be standardized across the site for all external link clicks.
Photo Suite
Exhibitors
Dealers  (Collapse with other dealer related pages and content.)
Artists
Art Show
Community Row
Press
Volunteer
Admin
Search
Landing page

Primary CTA: None
There is no clear sense of what I need to or can do on the landing page. There are plenty of links on the site, but nothing is called out specifically. I think we can try to align this a bit more with the organization goals and funnel traffic towards the desired content. The links can also be improved by making them more actionable using clear concise verbs to describe the expected action as opposed to the linked page.
