These notes are strictly focusing on the navigation menu’s IA.
I am focusing with the mindset that all information should be at maximum three clicks away including the nav menu itself.

“About Us” and “Contact us” should be top level navigation instead of under Info and listed last. My thought:
About Us
Convention History
Staff Listing
Board Members
New England Anime Society
Media
News
Contact Us

“Information” should contain more about the policies, schedule etc. It’s a bit of a loaded word because it can contain so many things but I think it could work if we have the right materials in there.
Con Information
Schedule
Area Dining
Policies
FAQs
Registration
Hotel
Travel Info
Guests

“Activities” is this meant to be a list of all things you can do at the con with or without applying or just things without applications? On it’s own it tells me everything but the divide between this and “participation” category can confuse people since some things are split or buried in other pages.

Having a separate page between activities and applications altogether would make sense and that would work with any application outside of programming. With that in mind:
Activities
Exhibition Rooms
Dealer’s Room
Artist Alley
Community Row
Art Show
Cosplay
Charity
Blood Drive
Charity Auction
Formal Ball
Programming
Premieres
Live Gaming
Concerts
Cosplay Gatherings

Other activities

New category:

Cosplay HQ stuff
AMV
Dealer’s room
Artist alley
Community row
Anything else that falls in here

Nav menu lists are not sorted in a specific order.
