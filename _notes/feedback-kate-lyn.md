Feedback on AB Redesign

Homepage:
    Layout one- I like this design the best. The buttons are so in your face there is no reason for attendees to ask where can I book my ticket/hotel/contact xyz? News on the left reminds me of the old blog days. (Note that the links to the new blogs do no function currently). I do feel like the space under the countdown to AB is empty. Could the news section go here instead?

    Layout two - I’m okay with this layout, I feel like this layout better utilizes this space better than layout one. Something about have the three buttons on the left bothers me. Maybe because I’m right-handed, not left-handed? I tend to always look right for buttons. (Could just be me). (Note that the links to the new blogs do no function currently)

    Bottom section -  I like the quick links and upcoming schedule. I don’t think we need two of the same news feed section. One on top and the bottom? Still like the Gallery being up there and social links that are visible.

Info Section:

    Attend/Registration -  I LOVE this!! However, I don’t think the tickets remaining should be in red all the time. Maybe use a stoplight system? Green for 30-15k, 15-5k yellow, less than 5k tickets orange, sold-out red? I like how it says when the ticket counter was last updated. Just a note you do have the reg policy listed twice, (once under the button) and again in the gray buttons. The search bar does not work.
Reg policy- I would just bold the first number for each rule. It’s very wall-of-text like. Has reg_fine_print on the bottom of the section.
        Price Page - YES YES YES I love this, I love how this is set up. This is perfect.
        Travel Page - Content needs updating (dates from 2017 updated) The spot Hero thing in the page looks weird. Anyways to have it fill the page horizontal so it doesn’t look empty? I would remove the travel Discounts section unless you think we are going to get any within the next few years.
        Hotel Info - Weird that it likes to another page then another page, but still works. Maybe make the hotel code of conduct bold or larger font. It will be two years since the last AB if we have it in 2022 and some young attendees may not know/be aware of the rules.
        Registration Events - Looks good no comments.
        Reg FAQ - I would change the 4 categories from 1-4 to A-D. Less confusing.
        Group Registration - I would make the button bigger or change the color to stand out more.

    Contact us - No comment, looks good.
    Staff listing - Any way to maybe suggest something is staff HQ to hide a name from a staff list incase of stalkers/job reasons? Otherwise looks good.
    Around Boston - The only comment is you need some cool A-chan and B-kun images! :)
    About Anime Boston - No Comment

Activities Section

    Programming - I would rename this to Programming Schedule, or Schedule programming. I would make the button on the left slightly lighter in color and bigger. The schedule itself looks like it was made for ants. I was wondering, What if they can choose between Hynes and Sheraton and see only the schedule for those areas? I know they might complain about switching back and forth but might help make the text not so small. That or flip the X and Y axis so time is on top and rooms are on the left since time is only 24-hour format. Love the schedule legend button clicks!
Guests: I love this, only thing is each link just displays Ray Chase.
    Dealers Room: I like the buttons on the right side! Subtle leading to AA or Dealers.
    Artist Ally: Again love the buttons, no comment otherwise.
    Cosplay: Be careful, I would remove Formal, Semi-Formal, Gameshows, Karaoke, and Maid Cafe from the page if kept as Cosplay Page. For the sake of staff getting along, I would just stick to keeping it cosplay only on the cosplay page. That or rename the page to be called Programming Events, in which everything under the sun is covered and everyone stays happy.
    Live Gaming - If you rename cosplay to Programming events you honestly and remove this page and add it to programming events.
Charity Auction Listing - I love this, lists everything plus a quick descriptions and time that it will be auctioned off. The only comment is not everything has a time on top and 15mins for 4 items seems fast to me.
Media: This is pretty cool, only comment is any way to add the rest of the years for the program guides?

Participation:

    AMV Contest- Might want to make the question test smaller on the page. I like the buttons on the right again, I don’t have any comments.
    Blood Drive: No comments, look good. If red cross has FAQs maybe add it in here, I know not everyone can give blood.
    Panels - Same as AMVs, make the question text smaller.
    Cosplay Events - Maybe make the buttons 3X3 instead of 4X2? That or bold the text in the boxes to stand out more. Otherwise, I like how everything is laid out. Mmmm that cosplay database is the best.
Cosplay Gatherings - Do you have to be signed in to add to the schedule? Want to make sure people can’t delete others and take over their spot.
    Cosplay Forums - I don’t know if this needs to be here? You would have to get cosplay departments’ thoughts on that one.
    Photo Suite - Same as AMV and Panels, make the question text smaller.


Exhibitors: At first I was confused on why there are dealers in two spots on the menu bar. Then I understood that one is for the attendees’ side, and the other for Dealers/Artist Ally.  I don’t know what you could add to either to try and clarify which is which. Or just wait for attendees to get used to it.

    Dealers- No comments, love the buttons on the right.
Artist Ally - Loving the layout, it just flows when I read it. For the FAQ on AA, change 1-2 categories to A-B to be less confusing.
Artshow - No comment
Community Row -  I would link the MCCA rules/policy so people don’t give away sand/glitter/etc. Because people were uhh doing that.

Press: Capitalize the items listed, all are currently lower case. The star needs to be added to the bottom text so people can connect the dots.

Volunteer:
Staff Guideline - Adjust the requirements to be A-D not 1-4 for clarity. I would bold or underline or something on the privacy and non-disclosure. (I feel like include sharing on social media can count as a strick against you but that’s my thoughts).
Staff HQ - All buttons work. All links work.
Support Squad - FAQ, same as other’s make the question text smaller.

Admin -  Shows up on all pages FYI.

TL;DR:

-Some places need bigger buttons or the text on the button to be bold.
-Some text is too big
-Rename cosplay to Programming events, or remove non-cosplay events
-The # of tickets left should be a stoplight system instead of red all the time. Red generally means caution and might have negative effects than positive.
-Layout One > Two imo
