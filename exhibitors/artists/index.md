# Artists Alley

The Anime Boston Artists' Alley is where artists and crafters sell their own works and creations. Whether you are looking for original pieces or fan-art, this is the place to go.

Anime Boston would like to welcome back all the fine artists out there interested in our Artists' Alley as well as welcome new artists.

The Artists' Alley will be located in Hall A on the first floor of the Hynes. Our [FAQ](/AB-Site-Redesign/exhibitors/artists/faq.html) is lengthy, but a must-read as it covers questions regarding sign ups, policies, consequences for failures to abide by Artists' Alley policies, hours and more.

We ask that new artists please read the FAQ fully, and new artists feel free to avail yourselves of the [Beginners Guide](/AB-Site-Redesign/exhibitors/artists/beginners_guide.html) and the [Artists' Forum](https://forums.animeboston.com/viewforum.php?f=8) as resources to help you get started. We ask that veteran artists also read carefully as there have been some changes of varying degrees.

**Artists' Alley sign ups will happen in several phases:**
* First: [Pro Row](/AB-Site-Redesign/exhibitors/artists/pro_row.html) **(please read carefully to make sure you qualify)** applications will start on Wednesday, October 16, 2019 at 6:00pm ET and end on Wednesday, October 23, 2019 at 11:59pm ET. You will have a week to submit your name for consideration, after which applications will be closed. You will be notified of whether or not you made it in BEFORE the standard sign ups occur so that you can plan accordingly (should you need to reapply).
* Second: Standard Sign ups – no *special* restrictions apply other than what is listed for artists in the FAQ. Standard Sign Ups will open on Saturday, November 9, 2019 at an undisclosed time and end on Saturday, November 23, 2019. Please note that the opening time will not be before noon (12:00pm ET). **Selection will be done via a random lottery. Your chances are equally good on day one as on day seven.**

Applications are available at [the Artists' Alley Application](/AB-Site-Redesign/exhibitors/artists/artists_alley_form.html).

Any artist whose application is accepted then starts the second phase, Artists' Alley Registration. This is another form where more detailed information is entered regarding your needs as an Artist and then continues on to payment for Artists' Alley space and convention membership.

In addition to the Artists' Alley Registration, each artist selling their work must also submit an [Exhibitor Tax ID](/AB-Site-Redesign/exhibitors/exhibitor_tax_id.html). This is a Tax ID from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. Per Massachusetts state law, each artist must charge appropriate Massachusetts state sales tax, and report it to the Massachusetts Department of Revenue.

All artists must *read and comply* with all instructions, rules, and policies stated in the [Artists' Alley FAQ](/AB-Site-Redesign/exhibitors/artists/faq.html). Anime Boston is not responsible for any consequences resulting from failure to comply.

**REMEMBER:** Applying for a space when applications go live does NOT guarantee you a space. You will get confirmation of your application ONLY, not confirmation of space. The Artists' Alley Manager will then sort through and compare the list of artists with the amount of space available. Please allow 1-2 weeks for first wave's sorting. If you are approved you will get a confirmation emailed to you for the space. For more details please review the [FAQ](/AB-Site-Redesign/exhibitors/artists/faq.html).

Please remember that sign ups work in waves depending on artists who drop out or decide on a smaller space. Any artist who didn't automatically get in still has a chance, and everyone will be automatically placed on the wait list.

Also please remember that the Artists’ Alley is NOT the same as the Art Show – if you’re interested in that, please [contact the Art Show Manager](/coninfo/contact/18).

Please make sure to read the [FAQ](/AB-Site-Redesign/exhibitors/artists/faq.html) for plenty of information, including pricing for tables.

Any further questions about the Artists' Alley can be asked on the [Artists' Forum](https://forums.animeboston.com/viewforum.php?f=8), or by [contacting the Artists' Alley Manager](/coninfo/contact/16).
