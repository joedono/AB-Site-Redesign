# Welcome!
Hi! And welcome to the Anime Boston Site Redesign Project!!

Hopefully, you're here because we asked you to be. If you are, it's because we want your feedback on this new website. I'm sure you can agree that the existing website has a lot to improve upon (*cough* navigation *cough*), so this site is our attempt to do that. With that in mind, here are the goals we hope to accomplish with this redesign.

## Goals
1. Streamlined Navigation. Fewer top-level navigation item (the current site has almost 70 menu options...)
2. Fewer "walls of text" pages. We're aiming to break things up with MOAR IMAGES!!
3. More useful home page. News is pretty useful, but we have some better ideas :D
4. Easier to digest the information

## Shortcomings
Now, don't get too excited just yet. This redesigned website has some things we know are wrong with it. That's because our lovely webmaster wanted to put together **just enough** of the site that you could get an idea how it would function. Here are the problems we know about that you should leave off of your feedback.
1. **Broken Links** - All the menus and main navigation should work, but there are many broken links here, especially links within paragraphs of text.
2. **Placeholder Images** - We don't have any of the new art ready for this site yet, so all the images are just going to look like grey boxes with numbers in them. Use your imagination to think of the guest's face or A-Chan and B-Kun doing the thing the image is linked to.
3. **Duplicate Pages** - All the Guest details pages point at Ray Chase. Most of the Cosplay HQ Event pages point at Death Match. All the panels and videos links from the Programming Schedule point to the same event. You get the idea. These are all pages that are basically the same, so for right now, they're all exactly the same.

## We're Not Done
The site redesign isn't done (obviously, or you wouldn't be here :D), and there are areas that we haven't tackled yet. You're here to focus on whether we nailed goals 1, 2, and 3 above. Any issues you have with the font size or color or readability of things will be noted, but it'll be a little while before we get to that.

## What We Need From You
With that in mind, here's what we need from you.

First, we're willing to get feedback from you in a way that you're most comfortable. Ideally, one of our redesign team would set up an appointment with you and you'd share your screen while you go through the tasks below. If you're not comfortable with that, let us know and we'll work with you to find an alternative method.

Second, we're going to ask you to do a little acting. Pretend that it is the time before the convention. You want to do something you'd normally do on the website, such as register for the convention, sign up for a cosplay event, look through the programming schedule, etc. See if you can accomplish the same thing on the new website, and give us some feedback on your experience.

Lastly, we'll ask you for more general feedback. We asked for similar stuff on the existing site in that survey you completed. This is the time for you to speak your mind. (Almost) all feedback is useful, **especially** from someone seeing the site for the first time.

## Thank You!!
Seriously. You have no idea how thankful we are for your help. Contact the Anime Boston Web Staff if you have any questions.
