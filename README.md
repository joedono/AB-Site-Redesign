# Goals
1. Consolidate the existing page structure so that we reduce the number of top-level navigation items and make it easier to navigate the site.
2. Delete duplicate information or consolidate it onto fewer pages (FAQ pages and General Information pages, multiple "Policies" pages, etc)
3. Rearrange navigation to target specific audiences instead of being all at the same level (general attendee, participant, professional)
4. Re-design the Home Page to show more important site functionality more prominently, such as registering for the convention
5. Add more images to the site
