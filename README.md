# Anime Boston Site Redesign
This project is a redesign and a rearrangement of the existing Anime Boston website. This site will be only the front-end content, no back-end functionality or database or dynamic content. It'll be hosted on GitHub Pages to provide an easy way for stakeholders to view it as work progresses and provide feedback.

## Issues with the Current Site
1. Too many top-level navigation items. The main navigation sidebar has around 70+ links in it (if you include the Administrator section). That is way too many and has resulted in a cluttered navigation where the most important content can get buried.
2. Too many "policy" and "faq" style pages. A lot of the information can be consolidated into fewer pages.
3. Too much text. A lot of other convention websites use graphics of their mascots to illustrate the purpose of a page. When the navigation is rearranged, we can use images to entice people to click links to things they might not care about otherwise.
4. Unimportant Home Page. The home page right now is just the news feed. Other convention websites have a very "loud" home page with the most important information at that time up front. Examples are things like registration being open or the event being cancelled due to Covid.

## Goals
1. Consolidate the existing page structure so that we reduce the number of top-level navigation items and make it easier to navigate the site.
2. Delete duplicate information or consolidate it onto fewer pages (FAQ pages and General Information pages, multiple "Policies" pages, etc)
3. Add more images to the site to make navigation friendlier
4. Rearrange navigation to target specific audiences instead of being all at the same level (general attendee, participant, professional)
5. Re-design the Home Page to show more important site functionality more prominently, such as registering for the convention

## Audience Personas
We want to rearrange the site to better serve the different types of people who come to it. We've come up with 6 different personas that come to the site.

### Attendee
This person wants to attend Anime Boston. They need to know how to purchase a ticket, where they can stay, and how to get to the convention center. They sometimes have general questions about the convention. They'll find most of what they're looking for under the **Info** section of main navigation.

Pages that are important to this persona
- Online Registration
  - Pricing
  - Group Registration (for school or education groups)
- Hotel Information
- Registration Events
- Travel and Directions to the Convention Center
- Contact Us
- About Anime Boston

We've served this person if they can easily register for the convention and book their hotel stay.

### Spectator
This person wants to see things at Anime Boston. They already have their ticket (or are interested in purchasing one), and want to know what there is to do at the convention. They're only minorly interested in dressing up and not interested at all in putting in pre-convention work. They'll find most of what they're looking for under the **Activities** section of main navigation.

Pages that are important to this persona
- Programming Schedule
- Dealers Room Listing
- Artists Alley Listing
- Guests
- Autograph Schedule
- Video Games
- Manga Library
- Swap Meet
- Cosplay Events and Masquerade (descriptions only)
- Formal and Semi-Formal Ball
- Cosplay Photoshoots
- Karaoke
- Live Gaming
- etc. etc.

We've served this person if they can easily find events that are interesting to them.

### Participant
This person is a die-hard convention fan. They've spent hours, weeks, or months working on something and want to showcase it at the convention. It might be a cosplay, or an AMV, or a concept for a Panel, or their singing ability. This person thinks that what they've created is high enough quality to compete with other convention attendees. They'll find most of what they're looking for under the **Participation** section of main navigation.

Pages that are important to this persona
- AMV Contest Submission
- Panel Application
- Masquerade Application
- Masquerade Judges
- Cosplay Games Application
- Cosplay Gatherings
- Idol Showcase
- Cosplay Photo Suite
- Blood Drive?

We've served this person if they can easily learn about the convention events, can apply to be in one of the events, check the status of their application, and easily learn what to do once at the convention to participate in the event.

### Exhibitor
This person is a professional of some sort. They're attending the convention for business reasons. These people usually have to have some sort of contract or agreement or approval from the convention staff in order to operate their business at the convention. These people are looking to use the convention to make money. They'll find most of what they're looking for under the **Exhibitors** section of main navigation.

Pages that are important to this persona
- Dealer Registration
- Exhibitor Tax ID Submission
- Artists Alley Registration
- Press Pass Application?

We've served this person if they can easily learn what they need to prepare in order to do business with Anime Boston, and then how to submit an application to start the paperwork necessary to do business with Anime Boston.

### Volunteer
This person wants to give back to Anime Boston in some way, and would like to work for or volunteer for the convention itself. These people fall into two subcategories: Staff and Volunteers. To be perfectly confusing, the website refers to Staff as Volunteers and Volunteers as Support Squad. The difference is that Staff have actual positions/titles and are expected to provide more specialized services for the convention, and Volunteers (or Support Squad) are general help during the convention or go-fers. They'll find most of what they're looking for under the **Volunteer** section of main navigation.

Pages that are important to this persona
- Staff Application
- Volunteer/SupportSquad Application

We've served this person if they can easily learn what it takes to be on AB Staff and submit an application to the admins for approval.

### Administrator
This person occupies a high level position on AB Staff already and requires various tools from the website in order to do their job. This section will not be redesigned as part of this initiative, because it is not publicly accessible and those that do access it are already used to how pages and information are arranged.
