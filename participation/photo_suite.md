# Cosplay Photo Suite
{:.no_toc}

The Cosplay Photo Suite in Hynes 102 is Anime Boston's FREE option for getting your photo taken by our own professional staff photographers.

Individuals and groups (up to ten participants) are welcomed to come by for a 10-minute photography session with a maximum of 5 photos per session. Sessions are available on a first-come, first-served basis with minimal wait times.

At least one photo of each person in a session will be posted to our [gallery](http://gallery.animeboston.com) about a month after the convention ends. There is no charge for this service.

Anyone who would like to receive their photos during the convention can opt to purchase the services of our Digital Studio, within the Cosplay Photo Suite. The Digital Studio costs $20 per session.

This optional service provides delivery of your photos digitally via email by the end of the weekend. The best photos from your session are cleaned up and enhanced by our professional photo editors.

Photos are subject to availability at the discretion of the Photo Editor. Delivery may be made to only 1 email address per purchase. All sales are final. Please inquire within for additional terms and conditions.</p>
