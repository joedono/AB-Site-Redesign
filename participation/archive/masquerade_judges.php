        <h3>Wayra Cosplay</h3>
        <p>Kara (Wayra) has been cosplaying since roughly 2010 after attending her first convention and falling in love with the idea of becoming her favorite fictional characters (mainly Yu-Gi-Oh, though ironically, she has yet to make a cosplay from this series). Since then, she has gone on to compete in cosplay craftsmanship competitions locally and internationally.</p>
        <p>Outside of cosplay, she uses the various skills and techniques she has learned through this art form to influence her fashion design work and is always looking to learn new forms of making that might further creativity!</p>
        <p>In her spare time she enjoys making lace and playing farming sim RPGs.</p>

        <h3>Frongi (Caps Lock Cosplay)</h3>
        <p>Frongi trained for fourteen years in tap, jazz, and ballet, and has competed up and down the east coast in both group and solo dance divisions. She twice performed in Disney World as well, but despite the magic, felt something was lacking. In 2006, she left dancing behind. Unable to part with the stage completely, she dove into theatre training... but stage theatre wasn’t right, either.</p>
        <p>In 2013, she found her place in the vocal booth. In 2015, she launched her commercial and narrative voiceover demos (they are at www.frongi.com). She has been working as a part-time professional voice actor ever since — on audiobooks, educational apps, TV ads, voicemail greeting systems, and more. Are animation demos next? Who knows!</p>
        <p>For now, Frongi is thrilled to bring her dance, theatre, and voiceover experience to the masquerade judging table — along with her almost fifteen years of cosplay experience! To the competitors — pierce the heavens, go beyond/plus ultra, get in the robot, and break a leg!</p>
