#### <a name="death">Death Match</a>
<img src="/images/cosplay/cosplay_games/deathmatch.png" class="img-responsive">

Thirty-two participants will enter, only one reigns supreme:

Characters go head-to-head to win audience favor and claim ultimate victory. In each fight, two teams enter the stage and the audience cheers (i.e., screams) for their favorite. The loser is wonderfully slaughtered by the winner in mock combat, and the victor moves on to the next round. The last one standing is declared the fan favorite for the year.

Notes on applying:
* Solo or group applications (up to four members total) are accepted.
* Applicants may be matched with characters from the same series to create a new team for the event.

#### <a name="dating">After Dark Dating Game</a>

Do you like wacky pairings with no canonical basis? This classic is your chance to see your favorite ship set sail as we kick off our After Dark (**18+**).

Each round, an eligible bachelor or bachelorette will ask questions to three potential partners to determine who to choose for a whirlwind romance! Questions range from comedic to innocent to blatant innuendo. Join us for some mature fun at this love-filled event.

Notes on applying:
* Solo or pair applications are accepted.
* **All applicants must be 18 or older.**
* If selected as a bachelor or bachelorette for this event, preparation before the convention will be required, which may include attending rehearsals/meetings.

#### <a name="lip">Lip Sync Battle</a>
Come cheer on your favorite anime characters as 16 contestants battle to become the ultimate Anime Boston idol. This hit is a highlight you don’t want to miss!

Contestants (usually individual characters, but groups are sometimes accepted) compete with each other in lip sync performances until a single winner is chosen by the cheers of the audience. Pop, rock, Broadway, comedic &mdash; all music genres are accepted. Come for the cosplay, stay for the jamming tunes!

Notes on applying:
* Solo or duets are accepted.
* Applicants will be asked for four songs they would like to perform. Songs will be cut down to between 60 and 90 seconds for the event.

#### <a name="improv">Improv Battle</a>
Our newest game returns for more cosplay fun that pits your favorite characters against each other... and the audience?!

Pre-selected teams of characters will face off in a series of improv games designed to have you rolling on the floor. But these cosplayers aren’t going it alone &mdash; members will be pulled from the audience to help (or hinder) the teams in these challenges.  Who will win? Come find out!

Notes on applying:
* Improv, theater, or other experience in roleplay required.
* If selected, participants will be asked to attend pre-convention meetings and a rehearsal at the convention.

#### <a name="shenanigans">Shenanigans</a>
What happens in Shenanigans, stays in Shenanigans. All we know is it involves cosplay. And possibly a chicken.

You definitely don’t want to miss this midnight event (**18+**) after the Masquerade!

#### <a name="chess">Chess</a>
<img src="/images/cosplay/cosplay_games/chess.png" class="img-responsive">

No Anime Boston is complete without the action, drama, and brutal battle of this larger-than-life game of chess!

Cosplayers represent pieces on a giant chess board as the two factions face off in this epic challenge between two chess masters. Every time a piece is taken, the losing piece is destroyed in mock combat &mdash; sometimes with the help of a special attack piece that appears just for the fight!

Notes on applying:
* Solo or group applications (up to four members total) are accepted.
* If selected, participants will be asked to attend a rehearsal at the convention on Saturday morning.

3. Log into your Forums account.
4. While logged in, go to [Cosplay HQ](http://www.animeboston.com/cosplayhq/).

**Step 2: Add profiles for any costumes you want to use when applying to events**
1. In Cosplay HQ, go to "My Costumes" and click "Create New Costume."
2. Each costume has space for a costume name (e.g. Super Saiyan Goku), character name (e.g. Goku), series name (e.g. Dragon Ball Z) and series genre (e.g. anime).
3. Once the costume is created, use the “Manage Photos” button to add up to three photos.
    * We recommend a full front shot, a full back shot, and a close-up of face/wig/makeup or other relevant details.
4. If you do not have your costume yet, feel free to use work-in-progress pictures (if making it yourself) or the store pictures (if buying online).
    * You can also use the “Other Info” section on the costume profile to write notes about pieces you are working on or will be receiving.
    * Make sure to replace these photos with pictures of yourself in the costume before the applications close (if possible).

**Step 3: Complete the application form when applications open**
1. Applications will open on January 1, 2020.

3. Under applications, check off any events that you wish to apply for. This will expand the form for that particular event.
4. You can apply for each event with up to three costumes per event.
    * As Anime Boston is an anime convention, cosplays from Japanese sources such as anime, manga, video games, and other Japanese media have a much higher chance of being accepted. Certain events may not be able to accept any non-Japanese costumes.
5. When you are done, click "Submit."
6. Submissions can be updated/edited at any time until applications close.

**Step 4: Look for emails from event coordinators**
