The Cosplay Photo Suite in Hynes 102 is Anime Boston's FREE option for getting your photo taken by our own professional staff photographers.

Individuals and groups (up to ten participants) are welcomed to come by for a 10-minute photography session with a maximum of 5 photos per session. Sessions are available on a first-come, first-served basis with minimal wait times.

At least one photo of each person in a session will be posted to our [gallery](http://gallery.animeboston.com) about a month after the convention ends. There is no charge for this service.

Anyone who would like to receive their photos during the convention can opt to purchase the services of our Digital Studio, within the Cosplay Photo Suite. The Digital Studio costs $20 per session.

This optional service provides delivery of your photos digitally via email by the end of the weekend. The best photos from your session are cleaned up and enhanced by our professional photo editors.

Photos are subject to availability at the discretion of the Photo Editor. Delivery may be made to only 1 email address per purchase. All sales are final. Please inquire within for additional terms and conditions.</p>

## NEW FOR 2015! PRINT SHOT IS NOW OPEN!  
For 2015, we are introducing a new print service available to Cosplay Photo Suite participants only. If you had your picture taken at the Cosplay Photo Suite, we now offer the option of purchasing a copy of your photo as a print.

**How it works:**
* Have your photo taken at the Cosplay Photo Suite and make sure your Model Release Form has been validated!
* Head over to the Photo Print Shop located in the Dealers' Room by the Anime Boston Merchandise booth. Be sure to bring your validated Model Release Form with you!
* Allow about 1-2 hours for your photo to make it to the Print Shop!
* Pay for your print at the Anime Boston Merchandise Booth. They will stamp your Model Release Form to indicate that you have paid.
* Present your validated and stamped Model Release Form to the Print Shop who will then locate your photo and print your order.

*Please note: print service may be subject to resource availability.*

## Reminders
* Keep your Model Release Form handy if you would like to obtain a print! Only those with a validated and stamped form will be allowed to purchase a print!
* You can only purchase your own photo. We are unable to sell you anyone else's photo, unless you AND that person are both in the photo!
* At the present time, you may purchase only one print per form. This is to prevent participants from hogging all of our resources.
* At the Photo Editor's discretion, you may be permitted to purchase a second copy of your print, depending on availability.
* The Photo Print Shop is available for participants of the Cosplay Photo Suite only. We cannot print your photos from your phone or camera!
* You may ask the Photo Editor to see if your photo has arrived and view it prior to purchase.
* Prints are always subject to availability and demand. We may run out of ink or paper and may not have prints available toward the end of the convention.
* ALL PHOTOS WILL BE SOLD AND PRINTED WITH THE AB WATERMARK! Please do not ask us to remove the watermark! We will place the watermark in an unobtrusive location.

**Hours of operation:** Photo Print Shot (Dealers' Room)
* Friday:12:00pm - 7:00pm
* Saturday: 10:00am - 7:00pm
* Sunday: 10:00am - 3:00pm
