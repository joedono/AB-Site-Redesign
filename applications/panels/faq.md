## What is a panel?
A panel can be a presentation, discussion, workshop, or game show about subjects on Japan, anime, anime-based video games, video games originating from Japan, and all other subjects covered under the["About Us” section of the Anime Boston website](/coninfo/about). Panels can be run by fellow attendees, guests, industry, or staff members. Panels may cater to a wide variety of audiences of all different ages. Please note that all panels catering to the 18+ age group will be scheduled during the evening (usually after 8 p.m.) and will be identified on the schedule as a panel that contains 18+ content.

## I am interested in running a panel, what do I need to do?
To submit a panel at Anime Boston, you need to fill out the [application](/AB-Site-Redesign/applications/panels/panel_submission.html) form on the website. Applications open on October 5, 2019 and close on January 31, 2020.

## What panels does Anime Boston look for?
Anime Boston primarily accepts panels that include but are not limited to providing information/education about Japan, Japanese culture, anime, manga, cosplay, video games, art history, and all other subjects that are covered under the ["About Us" section of the Anime Boston website](/AB-Site-Redesign/about/about.html). Panels that provide information on social issues that pertain to the current culture of the anime convention community may also be considered.

## How does Anime Boston decide what panels make it into the schedule?
Panel selection is done based on the cumulative ratings given by Anime Boston's staff members. Panels are rated on a scale of one to five. An example of a five rating is a panel that follows the Anime Boston charter and is well written. An example of a one rating is a panel that does not follow the charter and/or is poorly described and written, and could use improvement. The panel schedule is filled by adding the higher rated panels first and working down the waitlist until all the slots are filled.

## Does Anime Boston offer panel reimbursement?
Yes, Anime Boston provides badge reimbursement for the panel organizer only (the one who submits the panel). This is mailed out after the convention is over. However, if a co-panelist presents four or more panels with a panel organizer, they will also receive a badge reimbursement.

## Will you consider non-Japanese or Western related panels be allowed in?
At Anime Boston, we aim to select panels based on the Japanese culture and its influences on other cultures. This is the mission statement that Anime Boston was founded upon. However, as stated above, panels based on social issues that surround the anime convention community are considered along with panels that relate directly to all of the panel topics mentioned in the “What panels does Anime Boston look for?” section.

## Can I submit a game show or a cosplay game?
Yes, keeping in mind that Anime Boston does maintain our own Game Show and Cosplay Games staff. Unless your game show is different than the ones our staff plans to run, it has a very low chance of making it into the schedule.

## Can I perform at Anime Boston as a band/singer/standup comedian, etc?
Anime Boston strives to provide entertainment that is related to Japanese culture. As much as we love music, we can only consider entertainment that is of Japanese origin.

## When will I know about the status of my panel?
You should expect to be notified about panel submissions in late February 2020. At that time, you will be notified whether your panel is wait-listed, accepted, or rejected. If you do not receive an email by then, please contact our [Fan Panel Manager](/coninfo/contact/49).

## What happens if my panel is on the waitlist?
Having your panel on the waitlist means your panel fits our guidelines, but we do not have a space in the schedule at the current moment. Generally, everyone is on the waitlist at first while guest and industry panels are placed. If the convention draws near and you wish to be removed from the waitlist, please contact the [Fan Panel Manager](/coninfo/contact/49) and your panel will be removed. This does not affect your panel applications for the next year in any way. If your panel is still wait-listed by Thursday of the convention, it will most likely not make it into the schedule.

## What happens if my panel is rejected?
If a panel is rejected, it means it did not meet the Anime Boston requirements. However, just because it did not meet our convention’s requirements, does not mean it can’t be accepted elsewhere or that it can't be improved upon and submitted the following year.

## How old must I be to run a panel?
You must be 18 years of age by Thursday of the convention in order to run a panel. Co-panelists must be at least 16 years old.

## Can someone submit the panel for me if I am under 18?
Yes, however whoever submits the form is considered the panel organizer. They must do the panel check-in and stay in the room while the panel is being presented. If the panel organizer does not show up at the scheduled time, the panel will be canceled.

## Can I request a specific time?
When filling out the application, you can fill out preferred time slots and unavailable time slots. Keep in mind that the more flexible you can be, the easier it is for your panel to get scheduled. Please list possible general programming availability times such as morning, afternoon, or night blocks.

## What is the time limit?
Most panels at Anime Boston run from one hour to an hour and a half. Very rarely do fan panels run longer than 90 minutes.

## Can I request a specific room?
Yes you can, but that does not mean your panel will be scheduled in that room. Larger rooms are often pre-scheduled ahead of time with the industry and guest panels. Some spaces on the schedule are left empty intentionally.

## When will I know what time my panel is scheduled/accepted?
Once your panel has been scheduled, the status moves from wait-listed to accepted. You will then receive an email confirmation with the room and time. The time frame for receiving this notification is anywhere from late February to the Thursday of the convention (this is due to last-minute cancellations). In addition to an email confirmation, accepted panelists will be added to the fan panelist Discord channel. Discord is a popular messaging board app and the Discord channel will allow accepted panelists to communicate directly with the Anime Boston Fan Panel Manager and other accepted panelists.

## Once my panel is accepted, what do I have to do?
The panel organizer is required to check in for their panel(s), unless otherwise noted. Check-in for panelists starts Thursday night of the convention and ends Sunday. If you decide to check in Thursday of the convention during registration, panelists will have a designated check-in area after they have received their badges at the registration area between the times of 3 and 6 p.m. For all other times and days, the check-in area can be found in room 200 of the Hynes Convention Center. Please speak with the information desk if you have any trouble finding Hynes 200. Please note, it is highly suggested that you check in at least 30 minutes prior to your panel start time so you will have ample time to locate your room and set up. If you do not check in for your panel, you will not receive reimbursement for your badge.

## What tech does Anime Boston provide for panel rooms?
Anime Boston provides speakers, projectors, projector screens, microphones (stands and wireless), DVD players, and HDMI connectors for video and sound output.

## What tech does Anime Boston not provide for panel rooms?
Anime Boston does not provide laptops or adapters/converters. If you are using a Mac or HDMI, please bring your own adaptor with VGA to HDMI. When filling out your panel application, please be as descriptive as possible for Tech Staff so they can help accommodate your needs.

## Will there be Internet or Wifi?
There is Wi-Fi in the Hynes Convention Center, however it is not reliable, so please do not rely on it for your panel and do prepare ahead of time. If you need Wi-Fi connectivity for your panel, please bring a personal hotspot connection or any other device that will allow you to have Wi-Fi capability.

## Am I allowed to play full episodes of anime in my panel?
Please remember that most panels are only 50 minutes long. As such, please try to refrain from showing any individual clips longer than four minutes in length. At this time, we prohibit showing full episodes as part of any fan panel due to various legal requirements.

## When do panel submissions open and close for Anime Boston 2019?
Panel submissions open on October 5, 2019 and close on January 31, 2020.
