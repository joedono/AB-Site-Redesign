* Contact the Dealers' Room Manager via our [Contact Form](/coninfo/contact/17). Include that you are specifically requesting a booth, and the booth numbers of your primary * choice and alternatives.
* The Dealers' Room Manager may take several weeks to respond, given demand for space and other constraints.
* If you are confirmed by the Dealers' Room Manager to have space in the Dealers' Room, then you must mail a signed copy of the contract along with payment to the address provided in the contract.

**Please Note:**
* **<span class="text-danger">DO NOT SEND PAYMENTS OR CONTRACTS WITHOUT ARRANGING FOR SPACE FIRST!!</span>**
* Make sure you and your staff are aware of all limitations and requirements set forth within the contract.
* There is no guarantee of space until you have received acceptance confirmation from the Dealers' Room Manager, and your signed contract and payment have been received.

If you have any questions, please [contact the Dealers' Room Manager](/coninfo/contact/17).
