# Artists Alley Pro Row

Pro Row is a portion of the Artists' Alley meant to accommodate professional artists. **Opportunities for participation in the Artists' Alley Pro Row is based on a jury selection by a group of Anime Boston staff**. Due to space limitations in the Artists' Alley, the standard Artists' Alley table space application process is extremely competitive, as it is open to all interested artists. The Pro Row represents an alternate route to participation for professional artists.

The Pro Row process will accept applications from professional artists prior to the standard Artists' Alley Application phase. **The price per table is $525**.

Please note that even though the Pro Row Applications start before the standard Artists' Alley Application phase, Pro Row spaces are still limited in quantity.

This will affect the timeline between Applications and cause a longer delay between the different Application processes, since we want Pro Row to be resolved before we start the Standard Applications. If you do not make it in to Pro Row you will know before the standard Artists' Alley Application date so you may apply to that if you desire to.

Please be respectful of the jury choices. There is a limited amount of space and, subsequently, a limited number of tables to reasonably accommodate too many fantastic artists in our vibrant community. A reserve list of Pro Row applicants will be kept in case anyone drops out. While rare, it does happen.

Lastly, during our judging process, you will be required to link to your website. You will be responsible to ensure that your link works properly and brings us to the desired page. In addition, Tumblr links will not be permitted, as the site format is not conducive for a speedy evaluation. Any entries with invalid or broken links will be disqualified. We will not follow up with artists to get correct links or look for the pages on our own.

If you do not have your own website, we suggest using the portfolio feature of [DeviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com/) or a comparable service. This allows you to make a special folder to organize your artwork that you wish to be reviewed for your submission. This is especially important if your artwork contains fan art, as any art submitted for the Jury process should comply with the Pro Row's requirements regarding fan art, explained below. This way you are only being reviewed on what you plan to bring to the convention. All Pro Row spaces will be inspected at the show to ensure compliance regarding fan art is followed.

**Space is not guaranteed for each applicant**; however, there will be a smaller pool of applicants which *could* make getting space easier. There will also be a specific set of criteria that Pro Row artists must meet before being accepted, as well as a higher cost for the space.

Artists who cannot be accommodated through the Pro Row Application Process *will not* be automatically transferred into the standard Artists' Alley Application process. They must reapply on their own with the standard Artists' Alley Application with all other artists.

**Benefits of Pro Row**  
* Higher chance of being accepted due to higher criteria and cost.
* All Pro Row spaces are full 8 foot spaces.
* More likely to receive prime locations in the Artists' Alley. Please note that not all spaces will actually be placed in a single row.

**Requirements of Pro Row**  
* Each 8 foot space will cost $525. This does not include the cost of convention membership badges.
* All Pro Row artists who are applying as individuals **cannot** share their space with anyone. They also **cannot** sell any other artist's work.
* All Pro Row artists who are applying as studios must have been established for at least three years. They must also have projects that the entire studio has worked on together, and not just individual projects. All studio applicants will be investigated to confirm their legitimacy. Information will be gathered from previous Anime Boston Artists' Alley, as well as the Artists' Alleys of other conventions.
* The Pro Row is **not** for a group of individuals who want to pool money to afford an 8 foot space.
* **The majority of the artist's work must be original art and not fan art.** The focus is on an artist's own creations, and not the intellectual property of someone else. If your website only shows fanart, you will be disqualified.
* If you have any questions about qualifying for Pro Row, please [contact the Artists' Alley Manager](/coninfo/contact/16).

**Other Special Rules**  
* Cancellations of Pro Row space must be made by [contacting the Artists' Alley Manager](/coninfo/contact/16).
