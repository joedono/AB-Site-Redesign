# AMV Contest

Anime Boston's Anime Music Video Contest (AMV Contest) is an exhibition and competition of fan-created music videos with an anime theme. Hundreds of submitted videos will be narrowed down to a group of finalists.

Those finalist videos will be screened before an audience at Anime Boston. The audience will vote for their favorite videos and the winners will be presented during the Masquerade intermission.

Anime Boston has created the following rules in order to present the best possible Anime Music Video screening at Anime Boston. If you have any questions about these rules, please [check the FAQ](/programming/amv_contest_faq/) before you [contact the AMV Contest Coordinator](/coninfo/contact/42).

## Content Rules
* At least 75% of the footage in an entry must be from anime or Japanese-origin video games. This does not include American, European, or Korean animation that is anime-styled (e.g. *Avatar: The Last Airbender*, *Teen Titans*, *My Beautiful Girl Marie*, etc.).
* Entries may not contain any footage containing a watermark (i.e. the image in the corner identifying the broadcaster or editor, such as TV Tokyo, MBS, Cartoon Network, etc.). This includes footage where the watermark is partially obscured. If it appears that a watermark was present, your video will be disqualified.
* Entries may not contain subtitles from any commercial or fansubbed release. You may add your own subtitles where appropriate, but be aware that many people find them distracting and this may reduce your chances of your video being a finalist.
* Entries may not contain audio from the commercial English dub of the anime.
* At least 75% of the entry must be set to music. This rule does not apply to trailer and commercial parodies.
* Videos may not be collections of shorts. AMV Hell-style videos are not eligible for entry to the contest.
* Entries should not contain any title screens, logos, credits, or introductions before, during, or after the actual video. All title screens, logos, credits, or introductions before and/or after the actual video will be cut from the screening and replaced with Anime Boston's standard title screen. Entries containing credits during the video may be disqualified or have the credits removed at the Coordinator’s discretion.
* Entries must conform to CARA PG-13 rating standards. The [official ratings guidelines](http://filmratings.com/downloads/rating_rules.pdf) define PG-13 as follows:
    * A PG-13 rating is a sterner warning by the Rating Board to parents to determine whether their children under age 13 should view the motion picture, as some material might not be suited for them. A PG-13 motion picture may go beyond the PG rating in theme, violence, nudity, sensuality, language, adult activities or other elements, but does not reach the restricted R category. The theme of the motion picture by itself will not result in a rating greater than PG-13, although depictions of activities related to a mature theme may result in a restricted rating for the motion picture. Any drug use will initially require at least a PG-13 rating. More than brief nudity will require at least a PG-13 rating, but such nudity in a PG-13 rated motion picture generally will not be sexually oriented. There may be depictions of violence in a PG-13 movie, but generally not both realistic and extreme or persistent violence. A Motion picture's single use of one of the harsher sexually-derived words, though only as an expletive, initially requires at least a PG-13 rating. More than one such expletive requires an R rating, as must even one of those words used in a sexual context. The Rating Board nevertheless may rate such a motion picture PG-13 if, based on a special vote by a two-thirds majority, the Raters feel that most American parents would believe that a PG-13 rating is appropriate because of the context or manner in which the words are used or because the use of those words in the motion picture is inconspicuous.

## Technical Rules
* Entries may not be shorter than 30 seconds, nor longer than five minutes.
* Our video playback system can handle a wide variety of formats, but for your best results, we recommend the following settings:
    * Resolution: 1280x720 or 1920x1080 for widescreen; 960x720 or 1440x1080 for fullscreen.
    * Frame Rate: 23.976 frames per second
    * Video Codec: H264, 2 mbps or higher
    * Audio Codec: AAC, 160 kbps or higher
    * Audio Sampling Rate: 44.1kHz or 48kHz **lower sampling rates will be disqualified**
    * Container: MP4 or MKV
* The maximum file size of each entry is 1GB.
* An excellent tutorial for encoding your video to these recommendations is located at AMV101 [here](https://www.amv101.com/guides/encoding)
* Videos that have significant video or audio quality issues may be disqualified depending on the severity. Examples of issues that qualify include:
    * Interlacing
    * Squashed/stretched aspect ratios
    * Chunky/blocky video (often caused by low quality source or excessive data compression)
    * Extreme banding (i.e., Color gradients caused by video re-compression)
    * Jagged/saw-tooth lines (i.e., Line aliasing)
    * Audible distortion
    * Audio levels that are too high, overdriven, or clipped
    * Pitch-shifted or speed-adjusted audio (unless by obvious artistic necessity)

## Submission Rules
* Contestants must be at least 13 years old at the time of submission. Parents may submit on behalf of their children, but will be considered the entrant for the respective entry.
* Your entry must be your own work and no one else's. Anonymous submissions cannot be accepted.
* The entry deadline is February 28, 2020. All entries must be **in our hands** by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on this date.
* In order to keep the contest fresh, entries must be less than 1 year old as of the convention. Any video first publicly exhibited (convention showing or uploaded to an online video service) prior to April 10, 2019 is ineligible.
* Videos which have previously been submitted to Anime Boston are ineligible.
* Remastered versions of videos which have previously been submitted to Anime Boston are ineligible.
* Due to time constraints, contestants are limited to submitting one video per category, either as a sole creator or as part of a collaboration.
* Contestants are limited to contributing to a maximum of two entries. Further entries will be disqualified.
* Anime Boston and New England Anime Society staff members may compete in the AMV Contest, excepting those directly involved in planning and running the contest.
* The AMV Contest Coordinator reserves the right to change a video category if it is determined that the video more properly belongs in a different category than the one chosen by the creator. In such an instance, the creator will be contacted in advance when possible.
    * If this recategorization results in an editor having multiple entries in one category, the editor will be given the opportunity to withdraw one if the deadline has not yet passed. If the deadline has passed and the video is recategorized at the prescreening, one video will be disqualified at the coordinator's discretion, and will only play during the overflow showing.
* Entries may be submitted by filling out the [electronic submission form](/forms/amv/).
* Entrants will receive an email when their entry is received and processed. Due to the  high volume of entries near the submission deadline, this email may be delayed. Please be patient.

## At the Convention

### Preferred Seating
* If your entry is selected for the final competition, you will be on a list for preferred seating for yourself and one guest during all Anime Music Video Contest screenings at Anime Boston. Your real name will be used, along with your badge name or nickname.
* Although you will get preferred seating at the Anime Music Video Contest screenings, this **does not** qualify you for complimentary admission in any way.
* To claim your preferred seat, arrive 15 minutes before we open seating to the audience (so 45 minutes before the contest starts). Your name will be checked with the names of contestants and you will be shown to the reserved seating area.
* If you are not in your seat at least 15 minutes before the scheduled start of the screening, we reserve the right to open your spot to anyone still waiting to get into the contest.

## Awards

### Audience Voting
* There will be five finalist videos per category.
* The audience will be given a ballot with all the finalist entries in the contest listed, and be asked to choose which videos they think are the best in each respective category. The audience will be voting for Best Action, Best Drama, Best Fun/Comedy, Best Other, Best Romance, Best Trailer/Commercial, and Best Upbeat from the finalists in each respective category.

### Judges Awards
There will be three awards given by a panel of judges with film and music video editing experience:
* Best Concept - The best-executed idea behind a video.
* Best Editing - The video demonstrating the best technical accomplishment in editing.
* Judges’ Choice - The favorite video of the panel of judges.

### Coordinator's Choice
* There will be one award given by the Coordinator.
* All videos submitted to the contest that are not disqualified are eligible to win this award; it is not restricted to only the finalists.

### Editors Choice
* Finalists who will be attending the Anime Music Video Contest at the convention will be invited to jointly select a video in the finals to be given the Editors’ Choice Award.
* The format for this selection varies slightly from year to year and is modified by the editors in attendance in a given year.
* Further details regarding this award will be included in the email sent to each finalist following the prescreening.

### Best of Show
* Best of Show will be determined by a combination of audience votes and votes by the Judges’ Award panel.

### Winner Announcement and Award Pickup
* The winners for each award will be announced and shown in the Veterans Memorial Auditorium during the Masquerade intermission on Saturday night.
* Editors of winning videos or their designated proxy may pick up their trophies in the Fan Creations Track (Room 312) any time on Sunday of the convention.
* Awards that are not picked up at the convention will be mailed to the winners soon after the convention ends.
    * Winning editors not residing in the United States may be asked to pay a portion of the postal fees. In such a case, they will be contacted after the event to make any needed arrangements.
    * Winning editors are responsible for any taxes or duties levied.

### Categories
If any category does not receive a sufficient number of entries, it will be removed and videos that were submitted to it will be recategorized to the next most appropriate category. Any recategorized video will not count against the one per category entry limit for the creator(s).
* **Action** - Action videos feature adrenaline. Whether through combat, competition, or just plain speed, these are the videos that get the heart pumping faster.
* **Drama** - Drama videos tell a story, an emotion, or the story of an emotion. Sadness, nostalgia, anger, and more feature in these videos that tug the heartstrings.
* **Fun/Comedy** - These are the videos that make you want to smile, if not laugh out loud. It’s not just the anime or the song, it’s the originality that the editor adds that makes the winning videos in this category shine.
* **Other** - This category is for videos that don’t precisely fit into the rest of the categories. Horror, experimental videos, art pieces, WTF’ers, etc. They all go here.
* **Romance/Sentimental** - Where drama videos are about emotion, these videos are about relationships. Platonic, familial, or romantic love that a person feels for someone or something else is the common thread through these videos.
* **Trailer/Commercial** - This category is for original or parody movie trailers, commercials, and opening sequences.
* **Upbeat** - This category is for videos that make you get your body moving, feel the groove, or just bring a smile to your face. Dance, trance, techno, happy slice of life pieces and other types of the sort.

## Other Provisions
* By submitting an entry, each contestant agrees: they have read, understand and will comply with these official rules, and to the extent permitted by law, consent to the use of the entrant's name, likeness and/or biographical data for purposes of advertising and promotion by New England Anime Society or Anime Boston, without further consent, compensation or approval.
* Submitted materials become the property of New England Anime Society. By submitting a video to Anime Boston, the video creator grants New England Anime Society non-revocable permission to exhibit that video.

* The prizes being awarded may constitute income under applicable federal, state, and local tax laws and winners shall be solely responsible for payment of any and all taxes, which may be due with respect to the acceptance of the prize.
* We cannot be held responsible for lost or misdirected entries.
