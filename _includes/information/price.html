<strong>Registration Hours of Operation</strong>
Hours of operation will be as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Thursday, April 9: 3:00 PM - 8:30 PM <strong>Pre-registered members ONLY</strong></li>
  <li>Friday, April 10: 8:30 AM - 8:00 PM (We will be open from 8:00 AM - 8:30 AM for pre-registered members)</li>
  <li>Saturday, April 11: 8:30 AM - 8:00 PM (We will be open from 8:00 AM - 8:30 AM for pre-registered members)</li>

</ul>

<p>
  Please note that these are <em>registration</em> hours, NOT convention hours!
  The convention does not start until Friday morning. Our Thursday hours are so people
  who have pre-registered can pick up their membership badge the night before the
  convention starts and not have to wait in line on Friday morning. It also helps to cut down on the lines.
