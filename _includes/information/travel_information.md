#### 1. <a name="travel1">Anime Boston by Air</a>
Sell me a ticket for that airplane, ain't got time to take a fast train. Lonely days are gone, I'm a going to Anime Boston...

There are many flights into Logan International Airport (the closest airport to Anime Boston) and even more ways to make your way from the airport to us! Here we have a few ways that will help you leave the safety of the airlines and join your fellow Otaku in celebrating all things Anime Boston!!

*Option 1*: The Subway – Boston's Subway system known as the T can get you from the airport to Hynes Convention Center fairly quickly – Here's how (all Rates are valid as of January 22, 2018):

**From Logan Airport to the convention via Subway:**  
1. Take a free bus from your terminal to the MBTA Blue Line subway station. (Bus 22 serves terminals A and B. Bus 33 serves terminals C and E.)
2. Purchase a Charlie Ticket from the Vending Machines ($2.75 per ride) or get a Charlie Card and add money to the card (Charlie Card is Free - $2.25 per ride) and take the Silver Line Bus inbound to South Station, the Silver Line stops at all terminals.
3. Switch from the Silver Line Bus to Red Line Inbound going towards Alewife getting off at Park St.
4. Go upstairs one level and change to any Outbound Green Line trolley.
5. If you take a "B", "C", or "D" trolley, get off at the Hynes/ICA stop. When you exit the station, go left on Mass. Ave and left onto Boylston Street. The Hynes Convention Center will be on your right.

Subway maps are available on the <a href="http://www.mbta.com/" target="\_blank">MBTA web site</a>.

*Option 2*: Taxi or Airport Van (All rates valid as of January 11, 2017)

**Taxis and vans:**  
If you choose to take a taxi cab or airport van, these can be twice as fast (depending on traffic) but significantly more expensive (A taxi costs about $35 between Logan Airport and the Hynes Convention Center, not including tip). All taxis in Boston have a rate set by the Commissioner of Transportation.

The rate is $2.60 for the first 1/7th mile or less and $0.47 for each additional mile after the first 1/7th mile. All Taxis have a set waiting fee of $28.00 per hour.

If you are coming from the airport there will be an additional $8.00 in toll fees for going to/coming from the airport. There is a taxi stand at all terminals with relevant fee information as well as sanctioned taxis available for use. Returning to Logan you will be charged an additional $2.75.

If you wish to call a taxi service there are seven sanctioned companies in the city of Boston:
* Boston Cab Associates- 617.536.3200
* Top Cab- 617.266.4800

*Option 3*: Renting a car – There are several rental car companies available at the airport.
<!--
We'd recommend taking the subway, taxi, or van before renting a car unless you plan to go some place outside the city that is not accessible via subway. If you still wish to rent a car, check our [driving directions](#4)

For detailed information to and from Logan Airport, call 1-800-23-LOGAN (TTY: 1-800-262-3335)

**Tourist Note**: Boston's subway system is known as "The T". It's short for "MBTA" which is short for "Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority". All T stations, stops, and vehicles are marked with a black "T" in a white circle. You can ride it between almost any two stops with a Charlie Ticket from a vending machine for $2.65 or you can get a Charlie Card for free at most major "T" stations and add value to the card.

**Taking the T to the convention:**
